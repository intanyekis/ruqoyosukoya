Of course, as sweet as their reunion is, it’s come none-too-soon for Sally’s new business venture, as Adam’s decided to play white knight and ride in to rescue her floundering company.</p><p>And if he succeeds in talking dear old dad into keeping Sally and her designs flush with cash, we’ve got a feeling she’ll be even more over the moon with him than ever! Of course, right now, Victor’s not taking the bait. And there’s always the chance that Sally bristles over Adam going behind her back and trying to fold her in to Newman (not to mention putting her under Victor’s thumb after his cruelty).</p><p>But we’re hoping for love to win this time around. And we’re not alone!</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Sally-Adam-YR-CBS_9fd294.jpg alt="Sally Adam Y&R" width=1024 height=598 sizes="(min-width: 100rem) 1000px, (min-width: 91rem) 681px, (min-width: 48rem) 450px, (max-width: 48rem) 250px" data-recalc-dims=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>When Mark Grossman talked with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Soap Opera Digest</a>, he admitted that he’s just as eager to see what happens next as the fans. “I’m interested to see where they’re going to take this! Maybe this leads to a wedding of some sort, or [who knows] how long it stays good [between them].”</p><p>A wedding, you say? Well, that was already Nick’s assumption when Adam first came to him proposing they convince Victor to help out her business. But it’s not quite where Adam is just yet. His portrayer, though, is another matter. Because you can definitely count on Grossman to champion marriage between Adam and Sally!</p><p>“I think I’d like that,” he told Digest. “It would be fun to do that whole thing and everything that goes along with that — you know, the proposal and then have a wedding. It would be really nice. So, yeah, I’m curious to see if they’re going to go that route. That would be a lot of fun.”</p><p>So while we don’t know what’s ahead for Sally and her company, it does sound like things are coming up roses where she and Adam are concerned — at least for a little while! What are your thoughts? Are you hoping Adam and Sally are heading for a wedding, or is it just too soon yet?</p><p><strong>Check out the couple’s unexpected love story in our <a href=# rel=noopener>Adam and Sally photo gallery</a> below!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmraCVYsawwc2gZJqmlGLBqbGMq5ysrJyawLR7zZ6urGdnZoR5hZZomJ2ZnWLAorjLsmSmmaKnxnA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
