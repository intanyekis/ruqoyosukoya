Not only did they blend their personal lives, but <a href=#>the twosome frequently collaborated</a> with each other in the studio. Lambert’s 2012 hit “Over You” — which Song of the Year at both the CMA Awards and the ACM Awards — was <a href=#>inspired by her then-spouse</a>.</p><p>“My ex-husband, Blake, had lost a brother and it’s one of those moments where even if you’re married to someone, sometimes you find something new about them,” the “Bluebird” songstress recalled during a 2021 Apple Music interview. “Dudes don’t open up about things, but he started telling me about the experience of it all.”</p><p>While they worked together on the song, <a href=#>Lambert encouraged Shelton</a> to put his grief into words. “[I said], ‘I would never try to write your story because I didn’t live it, but maybe I could help because I’m an outside perspective. … I feel your pain talking to me right now.’ It was really a special moment and I’m so glad we shared that song and that it helped his family heal, to have that together.”</p><p>Though they were one of the genre’s biggest power couples, <a href=#>the duo called it quits in July 2015</a>, finalizing their divorce hours after announcing their split.</p><p>“There are no hard feelings,” a source exclusively told Us Weekly shortly after Lambert and Shelton’s breakup made headlines. “They want to <a href=#>move on as friends</a>, and they are doing just that.”</p><p>Both the Voice coach and the “Settling Down” performer <a href=#>have since remarried</a>, with Shelton and <a href=#><strong>Gwen Stefani</strong></a> exchanging vows in July 2021. Lambert, for her part, announced in February 2019 that she <a href=#>secretly tied the knot</a> with <a href=#><strong>Brendan McLoughlin</strong></a> one month prior. The couple were <a href=#>together for three weeks</a> before getting married.</p><p>“Blake found about the wedding at the same time everyone else did,” an insider told Us at the time, adding that the “Someday” crooner <a href=#>“had almost zero contact” with Lambert</a> after they called it quits.</p><p>Though Shelton and the “If I Was a Cowboy” artist have remained relatively quiet about their divorce, Lambert <a href=#>reflected on the intense scrutiny</a> the former couple initially faced following their separation.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I’ve learned a lot about myself and I think at some point you start to settle into who you are,” she told CBS News in May 2022, noting that she’d “grown up” a lot in the wake of her split. “I think that’s why you feel that peace coming from me because I feel at peace with myself.”</p><p>Scroll down for a look back at Shelton and Lambert’s romance and split:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkuqq%2BwKebmmWclrqjsdGtZJukkaCybr%2FHnqOtp56oerOxy5qroqeeqLWqvIytoKadnJ67pnnPoaatp6Nk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
