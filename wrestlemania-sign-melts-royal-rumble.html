That means a couple of things. Most importantly of all, by the end of the show, we will have discovered two of the Superstars who will be in main event matches at WrestleMania. The winners of the men's and women's Royal Rumbles. Those two Superstars also become the first people of the year to point at the WrestleMania sign, something you'll all be sick of two months from now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-sign-melting-wrestlemania-point>A Sign-Melting WrestleMania Point</h2><p>Since the women's Rumble was the first to take place this year, the winner of that match was the first person of 2022 to point at the new WrestleMania sign. <a href=#>The honor went to a returning Ronda Rousey</a> who, just four months after giving birth, entered the match at number 28 and went on to book her spot at WrestleMania.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Mickie James Brings Impact Knockouts Championship To WWE Ring At Royal Rumble</a></span></p><p>Rousey struck the same pose that she hit when making her WWE debut four years ago after the first-ever women's Royal Rumble, prompting pyro to go off around the WrestleMania sign. What she didn't realize, in fact what hopefully no one realized, is the fireworks would generate so much heat that it would cause the sign to melt.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=clear-the-area>Clear The Area</h2><p>The molten 'Mania sign apparently dropped or dripped, depending on what it's made of, on the fans sitting below. As you can see in the tweet above courtesy of Fightful's Sean Ross Sapp, the entire section was evacuated to prevent anyone from getting burned or injured. It's currently unclear whether the section was evacuated quickly enough to completely avoid any fans getting hurt during the incident.</p><p>Rousey has returned to WWE and already booked her spot at WrestleMania. <a href=#>It's assumed she will challenge Charlotte Flair</a>, the final woman she dumped over the top rope, on The Grandest Stage Of Them All. Nothing is set in stone just yet, but if that is the case, it only seems fair that Becky Lynch is shoehorned into the match for no reason whatsoever.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmenp7K0wMuepJqmmZZ6tLXGp2SmnZypwG6%2BzrKYpWWiqrqjuMRo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
