He is the&nbsp;quarterback for the New York Jets (NYJ). <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>He was selected in the 2021 <a href=# rel=follow>National Football League</a> (NFL) Drafts’ second overall by the Jets. Before that, Wilson was signed to play college football for Brigham Young University (BYU).&nbsp;</p><p>Wilson is a very accomplished football player. He played football professionally since high school and has not stopped to date.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The quarterback has a strong support system. His family has been there for him throughout his journey. Similarly, he has a girlfriend who has been with him through thick and thin.&nbsp;</p><p>Here is everything you need to know about Wilson’s love life and family.&nbsp;</p><h2>Is Zach Wilson Married?</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>No, Wilson is not married. However, he is in a long-term relationship with his girlfriend, Abbey Gile.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The duo <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">met</a> when they were in high school. Wilson studied at Corner Canyon High School in Utah, whereas&nbsp;Gile attended Brighton High School. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Even though they did not attend the same school, they knew each other. Their relationship began in 2017.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The first public picture Gile made of the duo was on Instagram. She posted a picture of the two on August 19, 2017. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Gile is a dancer. Back in February 2019, she and her team won first place at a Utah dance contest.&nbsp;</p><p>The couple is highly supportive of each other. In 2017, Wilson <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">missed</a> his last homecoming dance to see his girlfriend perform.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Similarly, as evident by Wilson’s Instagram, Gile is always present during his games and football events.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Zach Wilson’s Family</h2><p>Zach comes from a successful and hardworking <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">family</a>. His grandparents from his mother’s side of the family, Gary and Rose Neeleman have seven children. Those seven children have 36 children of their own and 28 grandchildren.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>All of Zach's seven uncles and aunts, including his mother Lisa Wilson, are very accomplished. From lawyers and doctors to international bureau chiefs and entrepreneurs.&nbsp;The Neeleman family has it all.&nbsp;</p><p>Lisa is a personal trainer and has a business of sweatshirts and Tee-shirts. She has six children, out of which Zach is one of them.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>When he was young, the quarterback was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). ADHD is a trait that runs in the Neeleman family.&nbsp;&nbsp;Zach is under medication for it.&nbsp;</p><p>While ADHD hampered Zach’s studies, it aided him in playing football. Mike Wilson, the athlete’s father, is the one who inspired Zach to play the sport.&nbsp;</p><p>Mike was a football player himself. He was a defensive lineman in school. He later signed with the Utah Utes and played from 1992 to 1995.&nbsp;</p><p>Mike’s career in football ended after he had a severe knee injury. He underwent seven knee surgeries, which ended his dreams of being a football player.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>However, his&nbsp;legacy is now being carried by his son. Mike coached Zach’s little league football when Zach was young.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p>In the upcoming years, he helped the quarterback with workouts, passes, and drills. In addition, the father-son duo watched and studied football films to help get Zach better.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_7"></span><p>Mike was also his son’s private quarterback coach. He knew nothing about playing quarterback since he was a defensive lineman.&nbsp;</p><p>Regardless, for&nbsp;his son, Mike watched and studied from other coaches and YouTube videos. He taught himself to coach quarterbacks from the footwork to throwing motions.&nbsp;</p><p>To date, Mike reviews his son’s performances. Even though they live states apart, the father-son duo talk on the phone daily.&nbsp;</p><p>Zach also sends his practice videos to his dad. Mike gives the quarterback pointers and advice to help his son be one of the best players the NFL has seen.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGiqqaeiqcBwxsCcn2avmaHAsLqMoKCrpJantqa6w2efraWc</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
