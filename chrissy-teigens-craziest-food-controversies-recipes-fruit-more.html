The Cravings author has been at the center of several disagreements about her <a href=#>recipes</a>, restaurant recommendations and more and isn’t afraid to make her feelings known. Teigen also doesn’t shy away from <a href=#>standing up to her critics</a> or admitting when she’s made a mistake.</p><p>For example, when she made her version of a tuna casserole amid the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020, which was topped with jalapeño chips and cheddar cheese, she wasn’t afraid to clap back at a Twitter user who dubbed the dish “gross.”</p><p>“Good thing it’s not for u,” she responded at the time.</p><p>The Bring the Funny judge took a decidedly different approach that same month when, <a href=#>at the start of the coronavirus crisis</a>, she encouraged her Twitter followers to order food using a company that ships eats all over the country. As many social media users pointed out, her tweet was a tad ill-timed given that many eateries were forced to shut down because of the deadly pandemic. Others also noted that shipping food across the country during a crisis isn’t something everyone can afford.</p><p>Teigen later clarified that her intent was not to “shame” people, but instead to bring attention to small businesses nationwide that could use the financial support.</p><p>In April 2020, when a Twitter follower questioned why Teigen was getting so “<a href=#>defensive</a>” after sharing a photo of a bowl of chicken and dumplings she had made, she explained her tough stance. “Because I have 500 people s–tting on my food on Twitter every day,” she replied. “That’s why!”</p><p>The Lip Sync Battle cohost isn’t afraid of speaking her mind as it relates to other aspects of her life as well.</p><p>When Teigen posted a photo in December 2019 of her daughter, Luna, <a href=#>fixing the lapel of her mom’s blazer</a>, which had a plunging neckline and exposed a portion of her bare breast, the star had the perfect clapback after a <a href=#>troll</a> told her to “cover up.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“She sucked it for months and doesn’t mind it much,” the Chrissy’s Court star shot back.</p><p>Check out more of Teigen’s craziest food controversies below.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmn6efmXyxtcKtrKudo2Swqb7IrKqyZaSatqixzaxknKqRr7amv9NmnainlGKwsLrTq6avnaKotqa%2FjKucnKGgmsBustGuoK1lnaS%2Fpns%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
