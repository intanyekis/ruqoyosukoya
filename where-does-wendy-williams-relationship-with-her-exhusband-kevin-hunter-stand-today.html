The TV personality filed the court paperwork two years after Daily Mail had exclusively revealed how the former executive producer of Wendy<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">had been living a double life for more than 10 years</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to the publication, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hunter had been splitting his time between being with Williams</a> while also entertaining a lengthy affair with a woman named Sharina Hudson, whom he has since welcomed a child with. It’s believed that the mother of one knew about the relationship Hunter was having behind the scenes, but once things had gotten out publicly, Williams knew that her reputation was on the line, and since her ex had no plans of leaving his sidepiece, she decided to call it quits once and for all.</p><p>The disturbing part was that Hunter, who was an EP on Williams’ show, had little to no remorse about his actions towards the former radio DJ, despite the fact that he was practically using his ex-wife’s money to finance his lavish life with Hudson. So, where exactly does Williams’ relationship with Hunter stand today? Here’s the lowdown…</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=wendy-williams-is-she-still-on-good-terms-with-kevin-hunter>Wendy Williams: Is She Still On Good Terms With Kevin Hunter?</h2><p>Ending a 21-year marriage isn’t easy, but considering her ex-husband had been unfaithful for the majority of their time together, we’re pretty sure it wasn’t all that hard for Williams to close this chapter in her life once and for all. It also seemed like a blessing in disguise <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">that word got out about Hunter and Hudson’s affair</a> since Williams had allegedly known about the romance for at least a decade — but the public didn’t know about it, so she was willing to keep quiet, too.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Where Is Wendy Williams’ Ex Kevin Hunter’s Mistress Today?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the time of the divorce filing, a representation for the Wendy show said, “Wendy and her family have been a part of Debmar-Mercury for over 10 years. We respect their privacy regarding personal matters. As always, we remain committed to bringing an entertaining and topical show to our viewers.” Another rep for Williams continued, “Thank you to everyone for respecting the family's privacy during this time.</p><p>Kevin is supportive of Wendy and they are working through this process together. No additional comment will be provided at this time.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>By January 2020, Williams was legally a single woman again after hashing out a settlement plan with her Hunter that allowed her to move on with her life without any further drama concerning who gets what. According to reports, Williams had paid her former flame a whopping $250,000 towards him finding a new home after putting their Livingston, New Jersey mansion up for sale. Note that the sum she gave him was before proceedings concerning the share of their financial assets were discussed through their lawyers.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People Want Wendy Williams Canceled: 10 Times She’s Taken Things Too Far</a></span></p><p>The talk show host spent just under a year negotiating a deal with Hunter. Surprisingly, she opted not to include his infidelity in the divorce, which would have threatened the amount Hunter would have received per New Jersey law; instead, she listed the divorce as “irreconcilable differences.” Aside from an undisclosed amount she gave Hunter, Williams also agreed to cover his health insurance for the rest of his life on top of allowing him to keep all of his cars, which include a Ferrari and Rolls Royce. Proceeds from their NJ home were to be split after the property had sold, while Williams would gain full rights and ownership of Wendy Williams Productions Inc. and Wendy, Inc.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an interview with The Jess Cagle Show, Williams shared that while she didn’t regret meeting Hunter, she was devastated by his “serial” cheating behavior, and only hopes that they can co-parent their son, Kevin Hunter Jr., in a civil manner moving forward. "I don't regret the day of meeting him. I don't regret putting up with him for all 25 years,” she said.</p><p>"And that has nothing to do with him having this baby, or him having this side girl for almost 15 years of our marriage."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Celebrity Couples Who Tried Sharing A Bank Account</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I've known about her almost since the beginning. I've known that Kevin is a serial cheat.” She concluded by saying that she only communicates with Hunter when it concerns their son, but other than that, they are not on close speaking terms — and rightfully so. Williams has since purchased a bachelor pad in New York while Hunter and Hudson have relocated to Florida, where they have opened a barbershop and a pancake business, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a>.</p><p>Talking about her lengthy marriage to Hunter, Williams had told People, "The life that I'm living right now is my best life, and I have no guilt about saying that. I don't regret meeting Kevin, I don't regret falling in love, I don't regret staying with him for all 25 years, 21 of them married."</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Princess Love Throws Shade At Wendy Williams After She’s Spotted With Her Hubby</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZ2imnqlu8SsZLCdnpnGbsPIpaOimZ2oerOxy5qroqeeqLWqvIywoK2gXZ2ys3nEsZ%2Buq5KWu6V5yp6toqZdncKvwMSrZKyskaOxbsDOnZiyZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
