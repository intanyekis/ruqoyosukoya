Phoebe graduated from The Julliard School after studying art and is an aspiring designer who has been stepping into the world of fashion. She recently made appearances at the New York and Paris Fashion Week shows, and is becoming a viral social media star with other 300,000 followers on Instagram. Let's take a closer look at what Phoebe Gates does for a living and if she makes enough money to stand on her own two feet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-does-phoebe-gates-do-for-a-living>What Does Phoebe Gates Do For A Living?</h2><p>Following Phoebe Gate's 21st birthday in September 2023, fans became curious about how the billionaire heiress can support herself.

But it's not so surprising that she has such easy access to these celebrities when you consider who her parents are and the kind of wealth she's born into.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Phoebe has made certain to keep posting beautiful selfies of her striking poses on Instagram and TikTok as a way of promoting her love for fashion.

The platform is being described as being "the future of fashion," so customers will have to wait and see if her father's expertise in software user experience shined through on the app.</p><h2 id=what-is-phoebe-gates-39-net-worth>What Is Phoebe Gates' Net Worth?</h2><p>While it's assumed that being born to ultra-rich parents means that you'll automatically receive an enormous inheritance, some parents do their children a favor by not making life so easy. As an added measure of their unconventional parenting style, Bill and Melinda Gates have agreed to leave <a href=#>a modest inheritance to their children</a> - each receiving $10 million.</p><p>That's far from average for the average white-collar worker, but given their multi-billion-dollar fortune, that amount can be seen as mere pennies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/1.png><p>With Phoebe's net worth at $20 million, according to Forbes, we can say that she's been definitely making moves of her own that have been paying off.

Despite their elite global status and accumulation of affluence, they were vocal about doing the utmost to give their children a normal childhood. But when you're the child of Bill and Melinda Gates, it's hard not to notice that you're way more privileged than the average child.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/this-is-what-phoebe-gates-really-does-for-a-living-and-if-she-makes-enough-money-to-stand-on-her-own-two-feet.jpg><p>But her parents seemed to care enough not to allow their children to grow up spoiled or entitled. They made them split house chores frequently to learn a sense of responsibility. And Bill even admitted to not permitting his children to own a cell phone until they were fourteen years old. As a software inventor, he must have his reasons for not wanting them hooked on the screens too early.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Inside Phoebe Adele Gates' Relationship With Her Siblings</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, even with stringent measures in place, it was undoubtedly impossible for Phoebe to miss the massive mansion she inhabited as a child. Her parents' attempt at instilling a modest lifestyle was a challenge when the family lived in a $131 million palace that Bill named Xanadu 2.0. The behemoth building came equipped with seven bedrooms, twenty-four bathrooms, six kitchens, an indoor cinema, gym, trampoline room, a 60-foot swimming pool, and a 475-foot artificial beach.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYr2pu8SbnGafkamytHnDqJysZZakv26tjKWgr6GenHq0rcuaqbJlkp65rXnGmqueq12Zrrazx62cq2c%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
