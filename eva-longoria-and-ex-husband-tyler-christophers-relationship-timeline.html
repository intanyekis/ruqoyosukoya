At the time, Christopher was in his fourth year on the show playing Nikolas Cassadine.</p><h3>January 2022</h3><p>The two tied the knot two years after they first met.</p><h3>May 2002</h3><p>Longoria and Christopher looked like soap opera royalty at the 2002 Daytime Emmy Awards. Longoria, who was starring on The Young and the Restless at the time, rocked a black gown with an orange, pink and black tulle lining. Christopher, for his part, kept things classy in a black suit, blue dress shirt and gray patterned tie.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Eva-Longoria-and-Tyler-Christophers-Relationship-Timeline-The-Way-They-Were-04.jpg><h3>October 2002</h3><p>The former couple opted for casual looks at the Los Angeles premiere of <a href=#>Tuck Everlasting</a>. Longoria paired navy dress pants with a white cardigan and tan purse while Christopher sported jeans and an army green long-sleeved short.</p><h3>July 2003</h3><p>The duo dressed up again at the 33rd Annual Nosotros Golden Eagle Awards as Longoria complemented Christopher’s black suit and white button-up with a cool, navy blue mini dress.</p><h3>October 2003</h3><p>Longoria and Christopher were the epitome of early 2000s fashion at a Los Angeles pet adoption event. The actress accessorized her white tank and jeans with black sunglasses and a white pageboy hat. Christopher showed off her muscles in a gray graphic tank top and sweatpants.</p><h3>January 2004</h3><p>The exes finalized their divorce after two years of marriage.</p><h3>August 2008</h3><p>“He was a lovely man, but I was very young,” Longoria said in an interview, per <a href=# rel=noopener>Digital Spy</a>. “I didn’t know who I was, and I was still struggling as an actor. I was a terrible wife.”</p><h3>September 2013</h3><p>Following her marriages to Christopher and Parker, the Brooklyn Nine-Nine alum revealed she was <a href=#>unsure of whether she would marry again</a> and have kids. “I’m not one of those women who are like, ‘I must procreate!’” she said in an interview with Access Hollywood Live. “I think kids are a product of love. So if you find the right person and you want to have a family with that person, then that’s when the time is right. But…if I’m 50 and single, I’m not going to go do it myself.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Eva-Longoria-and-Tyler-Christophers-Relationship-Timeline-The-Way-They-Were-02.jpg><h3>August 2022</h3><p>Longoria seemingly shared more <a href=#>insight into her past marriages</a> during an episode of her <a href=# rel=noopener>“Connections with Eva Longoria” podcast</a>. “I think jealousy takes up such an amount of energy. I remember being so jealous and your stomach is inside out,” she revealed. “It’s the worst feeling. Why would anybody want that feeling?”</p><p>She continued: “I think that’s why, with my second marriage — no wait, my third — finding love at 40, I found [my husband] when I was 40 — and he was 50 — it was just like, ‘Can we just enjoy this life together?’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><h3>October 2023</h3><p>Christopher’s former General Hospital costar <strong>Maurice Benard</strong> revealed via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> that the actor passed away at the age of 50 “following a cardiac event in his San Diego apartment.”</p><p>Benard’s statement continued: “Tyler was a truly talented individual that lit up the screen in every scene he performed and relished bringing joy to his loyal fans through his acting. Tyler was a sweet soul and wonderful friend to all of those who knew him. Tyler was an advocate for better mental health and substance use treatment who openly spoke about his struggles with bipolar depression and alcohol. We are beyond devastated by the loss of our dear friend and pray for his children and his father.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaerpFiubC6xqipopldlrulecSxZKGto5eur7CMrbClnaJisKm%2ByKyrqKiYmr%2B0edGeo5qsmaS7tLTIqWStoZ2auaq6xGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
