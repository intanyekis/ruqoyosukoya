Fans were <a href=#>excited to see Derek return in season 17</a>, and it was definitely amazing seeing Meredith talk to him again on the beach.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Fans want Arizona to come back</a>, and it'll be interesting to see what the next season is like.

I’m not saying if [series creator] Shonda [Rhimes] was like, ‘We’re gonna do a very special episode of Grey’s where… ‘ But she really consciously, we did it all. We had the spinoff, and we had all that. It was an amazing experience and journey.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans who have watched Addison's amazing character arc on Private Private, the spin-off that the actress was referring to, know that she has been through so much since leaving Grey's Anatomy. Addison joined the other doctors at Oceanside Wellness in California and had an on-again, off-again relationship with Sam Bennett, her good friend Naomi's ex-husband. While it seemed like they would always be together, they broke up and by the end of the series, Addison had chosen Jake Reilly and they were raising baby Henry.</p><p>The drama between Meredith and Addison was always about Addison's ex-husband Derek Shepherd, of course, and now that Derek is gone, perhaps they can see eye to eye again. It'll be fascinating to see what happens.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ellis Grey will also come back</a>: according to Us Weekly, the trailer sees Ellis Grey asking Meredith, “You survived the unthinkable, what are you going to do Meredith?"

Owen and Teddy attempt to take the next step in their engagement, and Meredith has a surprising opportunity when she meets a dynamic doctor from her mother‘s past.”</p><p>This all sounds amazing, as there is a lot of drama happening. Fans love Miranda Bailey and it'll be hilarious watching her set high standards for the doctors that she wants to hire. Meredith's storyline also sounds really intriguing.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Are ‘Grey’s Anatomy’ Stars Katherine Heigl And T.R.
