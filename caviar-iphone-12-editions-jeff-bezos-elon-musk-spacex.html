The high-class design company is especially known for its limited edition of smartphones, as well as other devices such as video game consoles.</p><p>Caviar's line was launched in order to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the first-ever manned spaceflight which happened in 1961. As a way to commemorate&nbsp;this historical accomplishment, the luxury brand has named their new iPhone's limited edition designs, <a href=#>"Space Conquerors"</a>.</p><p>Furthermore, the brand is famous for expertly craft and create limited quantities of state-of-the-art high-tech designs. Therefore, the owners of a "Space Conquerors" iPhone will have the choice to select which&nbsp;famous space explorer they would like to see on their device.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">7 Shockingly Expensive Cell Phone Cases</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Caviar's designs will&nbsp;include an iconic lineup with&nbsp;Yuri Gagarin, Neil Armstrong, Sergei Korolev, Jeff Bezos and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elon Musk</a>. These fancy creations all make for very unique pieces of art.</p><p>Needless to say that these smartphones come at a hefty cost, and therefore will interest buyers who value their device's aesthetic over their bare functions. As a matter of fact, the price of the&nbsp;"Space Conquerors" phones starts at <a href=#>$5,840</a></p><p>The expensive price tag is justified by the costly materials used.&nbsp;The iPhone 12 Pro Max Gagarin edition, for instance, is crafted out of aviation-grade titanium and has a 3D miniature-sized Vostok-K rocket. This is a special little addition, as it is the same rocket that brought&nbsp;the Soviet cosmonaut, Yuri Gagarin, to orbit.</p><p>For those passionate of space history and science, they will appreciate the fact that the watch is the same one&nbsp;Gagarin used to track his 108 minutes in space. What makes the device all the more unique is the piece of the Vostok-1 capsule embedded in the phone.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Gagarin model's price starts at&nbsp;$8,920, making it the most expensive device of the collection. The "cheaper" design features&nbsp;a back made out of hardened titanium and depicts a white engraved feature on a blue background that resembles the logo of Blue Origin, which is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeff Bezos</a> private company, known for developing space rockets.</p><p>Each models are&nbsp;limited, with only a dozens of units made.</p><p><span class=next-single>Read Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elon Musk's SpaceX Wins $2.89 Billion Contract To Land Astronauts On The Moon</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gadgets</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">GadgetsNow</a>, <a href=#>The Indian Express</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSwosLImqlmoaCdvK%2BxjGppZp2UnsGqu82sZKOdlpt6o7HZqKpmnZyku2651KyiZquglrCmxI4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
