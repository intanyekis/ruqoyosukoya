The song "Gorgeous" begins with a baby cooing the title of the track. After the album was released, fans saw James Reynolds, Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively's eldest daughter, credited as the "baby intro voice" in the production notes.</p><p>Following the release of Reputation, Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds had two more children: Inez and Betty. Fans did not know that Betty was the name of their third child until Taylor Swift released her 2020 album Folklore.</p><p>The song "betty" features a love story between three people: Betty, James, and Inez. Knowing that James and Inez were the names of the first two children, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fans were correct in assuming that Betty was the name of Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively's third child</a>.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/taylor-swift-6.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Taylor Swift’s Lyrics Criticized For Being Insensitive After Fans Call Out A Minor Detail">Taylor Swift’s Lyrics Criticized For Being Insensitive After Fans Call Out A Minor Detail</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Taylor's lyrics call out a lot of celebrities, but they're being called tone deaf for a very specific reason.</p><h2 id=did-taylor-swift-reveal-the-name-of-blake-and-ryan-39-s-fourth-child>Did Taylor Swift Reveal The Name Of Blake And Ryan's Fourth Child?</h2><h3 id=fans-think-that-taylor-39-s-midnights-album-might-hold-a-clue-to-another-reynolds-name>Fans think that Taylor's Midnights album might hold a clue to another Reynolds name</h3><p></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/copy-of-untitled-37.jpg><p>In October 2022, Taylor Swift released her tenth studio album Midnights. In the song "You're On Your Own Kid," Taylor Swift sings, "I see the great escape / So long, Daisy May."</p><p>This has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">caused Swifties to speculate that Daisy May might have been the name of Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds' fourth child</a>. Some users believe that the name "Daisy May" fits perfectly with the names of the couple's other three children.</p><p>However, other Swifties have speculated that the name refers to the character of Margaret March from the book "Little Women" by Louisa May Alcott. Margaret is known as Meg to her family, but Daisy by her rich friends. It is possible that she combined the name of the first name of the character (Daisy) and the middle name of the author (May) to create a brand new name.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The name Daisy May can also sound like "dismay," matching the melancholy nature of the song.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/1-53.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Taylor Swift's Confusing Relationships With These Celebrities Rival Her Rumored Feud With Olivia Munn">Taylor Swift's Confusing Relationships With These Celebrities Rival Her Rumored Feud With Olivia Munn</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift is always the subject of rumors that she is feuding with a lot of other celebrities, including Olivia Munn.</p><h2 id=what-else-could-the-name-of-ryan-reynolds-and-blake-lively-39-s-fourth-child-be>What Else Could The Name Of Ryan Reynolds And Blake Lively's Fourth Child Be?</h2><h3 id=could-ryan-reynolds-and-blake-lively-have-chosen-the-name-from-a-taylor-swift-song-that-39-s-already-been-released>Could Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively have chosen the name from a Taylor Swift song that's already been released?</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/instar51493866.jpg><p>Since Taylor Swift leaked the name of Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds' third child, it is possible that the A-list couple decided to make sure that she couldn't do it again by choosing a name from a song that Swift had already released.</p><p>In 2020, years before the couple's fourth child was born, Taylor Swift released a song called "Dorothea" on her ninth studio album, Evermore. Some Swifties believe that Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively picked the name of their child from a song that already exists to show their love for Taylor Swift.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Other Swifties believe that Taylor Swift might have made fun of the Reynolds name speculation in her 2024 studio album, The Tortured Poets Department. Although the song "Chloe or Sam or Sophia or Marcus" is about infidelity, other fans have wondered if one of those four names is a clue to the fourth child's name.</p><p>Chloe, Sam, Sophia, or Marcus could also be a list of names that Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds were considering for their child but decided not to use. It is also possible that they named their child Clara, as "Clara Bow" is the title of another track on the album.</p><p>It is possible that Blake Lively named her daughter Clara Bow after the star of the silent screen, which prompted Taylor Swift to use her as a muse in her own song. There are also songs on the album named "Robin" and "Peter," which might provide a clue to the name of the couple's fourth child.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although Taylor Swift has yet to share the identity of the individuals who inspired the tracks on The Tortured Poets Department, fans still love to speculate, especially since <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor Swift called multiple people out</a> in the album.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdqa66uM6rZKyvmZvBbr7Er5yapF2XuaK3xGajoq6VocZursCbsGamkaKycA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
