The Talks Today</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><h2 id=what_happened_to_melanie_wright_sprouse class=smooth-goto>What happened to Melanie Wright Sprouse?</h2><p>Cole Sprouse recently shared some personal details about his life and career on the Call Her Daddy podcast. As a child actor, Sprouse and his twin brother Dylan made their first appearances on the American sitcom Friends and the film Big Daddy in 1999. However, it was their roles on the Disney show The Suite Life of Zack and Cody that catapulted them to stardom.</p><p>In his interview, Sprouse revealed that his acting career as a child was not a choice he made but rather a necessity. He explained that his mother, Melanie Wright Sprouse, struggled with mental health and addiction issues, which made it difficult for her to provide for her children. Acting became a means of income for the family, and Sprouse and his brother worked hard to put food on the table.</p><p>Sprouse explained that there are two types of child actors in the industry: those who choose to pursue acting as a career and those who, like himself and his brother, enter the industry out of necessity. For them, acting was a job, and their main goal was to support their family and help their mother provide for them. Unfortunately, despite their hard work and success, Sprouse and his brother did not get to keep the money they earned from their early acting gigs. Allegedly, their mother mismanaged their finances and lost all their earnings from Friends and Big Daddy. This loss of income was a devastating blow to the family, and it made it even more difficult for them to make ends meet. Ultimately, Melanie Wright Sprouse lost custody of her children due to her struggles with mental health and addiction. While the experience was undoubtedly difficult for Sprouse and his brother, it also shaped them into the resilient and hardworking individuals they are today.
