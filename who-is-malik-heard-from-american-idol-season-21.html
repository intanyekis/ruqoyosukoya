Season 21 of American Idol premieres on ABC on Sunday, April 2 at 8 p.m. ET.</p><h2>Malik Heard, a former The Voice contestant, will compete in season 21 of American Idol</h2><p>Malik Heard, a season 21 candidate on American Idol, previously competed in The Voice season 10 in 2016, when he was only 19 years old. He sang Chains for his Blind auditions, which helped him impress Pharrell Williams and Christina Aguilera while Blake Shelton and Adam Levine remained seated. Blake stated following his performance that he was glad Malik was on the show and that he had to choose between the other two judges.</p><p>He continued, saying:</p><p><strong>“Pharrell is about to be handed his b*tt right now.”</strong></p><p>Despite the fact that he had no idea what was going to happen and had intended to stay out of it, Adam Levine immediately promoted Pharrell Williams to the current American Idol season 21 competitor, saying he was fantastic. Christina told Malik that she realized something special was happening when she heard “some of those accurate, amazing runs,” and that she thought the two of them would make an excellent team.</p><p>She continued, saying:</p><p><strong>“I’d like to share my thoughts; I’d like to get inside your head; I truly believe we can do this together.”</strong></p><p>When asked who his influences were, Malik mentioned Sam Smith, Bruno Mars, Justin Timberlake, and others. The Happy artist went on to say that because he is a composer rather than a musician, he would deliver those types of tracks with either of the judges and that he would love to be a part of Malik’s path.</p><p>The season 21 American Idol contestant eventually chose Christina Aguilera as his coach, and his most memorable performance was in the Battle Round when he sang It’s a Man’s Man’s Man’s World with Byran Bautista. While Bryan won the round, Malik completed a quadruple grab and was able to select his instructor once more. He joined Pharrell Williams’ team but was eliminated in the next round.</p><h2>Malik Heard was born in the city of Dallas, Texas</h2><p>Malik Heard, a Season 21 contestant from Dallas, Texas, grew up in a busy family. He initially wanted to play sports but changed his mind as a junior in high school while attending Sachse High School. In high school, Malik participated in acapella, chamber choruses, and the school’s musical ensemble, Mane Attraction.</p><p>He took to social media on March 27 to announce that he had been chosen for season 21’s Hollywood Week, which begins this week. Season 21 of American Idol premieres on ABC on Sunday, April 2 at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p><span style=font-size:18pt data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Lenny Kravitz Girlfriend, Gay, Children"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1081857,"3":{"1":0},"12":0,"18":1,"23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/lenny-kravitz-girlfriend-gay-children-race/"}{"1":50}'>Also Read: <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Lenny Kravitz Girlfriend, Gay, Children</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Singer</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>James Cottriall</a></h3>James Cottriall estimated Net Worth, Biography, Age, Height, Dating, Relationship Records, Salary, Income, Cars, Lifestyles & many more details have been updated below.
