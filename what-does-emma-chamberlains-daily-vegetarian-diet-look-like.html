Probably too well done to a point where most people wouldn't want to eat it. I like my eggs almost burnt."</p><p>"Salt on it, pepper on it, 'Everything But The Bagel' seasoning on it," she listed off her personalized egg essentials, "Then I put some Cholula on that. Then I cut up a whole avocado, put that on top...That's my breakfast every day."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kylie Jenner's Favorite Foods (According To Social Media)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Chamberlain talked about her work-filled lifestyle and how completing as many professional tasks as possible is a priority.

Recently I've been ordering this salad from this <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">restaurant called Zinc</a>. It's kale, lentils, carrots, (a) hard-boiled egg, and this nice salty, shallot-y vinegarette on top."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Emma Chamberlain's 10 Best Instagram Outfits</a></span></p><p>A vegetarian burrito from LA's Tocaya Organica also often makes the cut as her choice of lunch.
