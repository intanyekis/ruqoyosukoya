Guess what? There’s an app for that. Here are the six best apps that can get you cheap Broadway tix with the flick of a finger.</span></p><p><span>TodayTix exists either to save you money, or entice you to spend even more of it. Either way, this easy-to-use app is loaded with discounts: 30 to 40 percent off seats, lotteries and same-day rush sales. (Jake Glyllenhaal’s acclaimed new “Sea Wall/A Life” was up recently with $35 rush seats.) Along with deals on Broadway’s hot “Oklahoma!” revival and other hits, the app doesn’t confine itself to Broadway — just input the city you’re in and the show you’re looking for, and it will dig up deals. Be warned, though: TodayTix charges a service fee of $12.50 per ticket.</span></p><ul><li><strong>BroadwayBox</strong></li></ul><p><span>As the name suggests, this app sells theater tickets only — both on Broadway and off — so you won’t have to filter through concerts and offbeat comedy shows to get to your seats, whether they’re in the orchestra, mezzanine or balcony. You can also save shows to a “favorites list” that will notify you when the price is right. The app gives you a promo code for your selected deal, which you then apply at ticket vendors like Telecharge and Ticketmaster.</span></p><ul><li><strong>BroadwayADay</strong></li></ul><p><span>A lottery seat can go for as low as $10, but who has time to enter all of them? BroadwayADay automatically enters lotteries for your selected shows every day, without you ever having to make ticket-buying a full-time pursuit. Added bonus: The app is free.&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><strong>Hamilton — The Official App</strong></li></ul><p><span>Daily trivia questions, a show blog, a merchandise store — the Hamilton app has it all. But its most important feature is the one that enters you into the show’s lottery. Every day, you can enter to win the chance to buy up to two tickets for just $10 each, as opposed to several hundred per seat. The discount tickets get you into a performance two days later. Everyone who’s been saving up for seats since the show opened in 2015 may want to download this one ASAP. And yes, the app is free.</span></p><ul><li><strong>Broadway.com</strong></li></ul><p><span>This free app gives you a rundown of every show with discount tickets on any given day, which might be helpful if you’re planning a stay in the city well in advance and don’t want to get into the messy business of day-of deals. You might just want to use it as a reference, however: Broadway.com’s service fee can be a whopping $30 per ticket.</span></p><p><span>Everybody knows about the booths, but did you know there’s also a TKTS app? While it doesn’t sell tickets, the app helps you navigate the best deals around by showing you what’s available at all three TKTS locations — in Times Square, South Street Seaport and Lincoln Center. It also offers tips for shorter wait times and gives directions and opening hours for all three discount-ticket booths.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlfnp7j3FmaXFfqbWmeZVmmZ6rpGKusbzSZquoZZKqxm6vx56YqWWSp7yisNaasGasmZi4psDSaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
