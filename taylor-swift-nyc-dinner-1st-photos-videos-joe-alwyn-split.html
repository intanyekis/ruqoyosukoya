The outing comes just two days after the “Anti-Hero” hitmaker <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>reportedly split</a> from her longtime beau, <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Joe Alwyn,&nbsp;</a></strong>32. While dining at Italian hotspot Via Carota, Taylor rocked a chic ensemble that featured an off-shoulder black blouse and jeans that featured a butterfly embellishment on her left leg. The blonde beauty completed her look with a silver chain purse and black leather high-heel pumps. Taylor styled her golden tresses straight down and also rocked bangs.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>🎥| A friend of <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>@13yearsoftay</a> has spotted Taylor in NYC tonight <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/eKlqWqe9Hd</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-3>— Taylor Swift Updates 🏟️ (@swifferupdates) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>April 11, 2023</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>In a fan video (<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>watch here</a>), Taylor joyously waved to fans while walking through the streets of the Big Apple. “Hi,” she could be seen mouthing, as her fans screamed, “I love you!” One fan noted in the comments section how quickly the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Grammy winner</a> got to NYC, as she was just <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>spotted in Liverpool</a> over the weekend. “now wasn’t she just in liverpool??”, the fan <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>asked</a>, while another <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>chimed in</a> with, “From Liverpool to NYC.. take a rest girlie.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>As her fans mentioned, the 33-year-old recording artist was seen working on an upcoming music video in the UK over the weekend (see <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>photos here</a>). Although Taylor herself was not spotted walking into the set, it was speculated that she was being transported via a large red bin, as she often goes incognito when entering her work spaces. In a <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>fan re-post</a> on Monday, Taylor was spotted running across a stage with her iconic curls while on set of her new music video. It is not yet known which music video she is working on, however, her video for <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“Lavender Haze”</a> was just released in January.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Taylor-Swift-Spotted-backgrid-embed-2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-7>Taylor and Jack’s dinner outing comes just two days after it was reported that she and her now-ex, Joe, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>called it quits</a>. A source told &nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Entertainment Tonight</a> on Apr. 8. that the split occurred “a few weeks ago”, however, they alleged it was “not dramatic.” The insider also claimed that, “the relationship had just run its course. It’s why [Joe] hasn’t been spotted at <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>any shows</a>.” Taylor is currently amid her&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Eras Tour</a>, which kicked off on Mar. 17.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Taylor-Swift-Spotted-backgrid-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>As many Swifties know, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Taylor and Joe dated</a> for nearly seven years. Although neither has confirmed their official meeting story, fans speculate that the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>two first met</a> at the 2016 Met Gala. The&nbsp;Conversations with Friends&nbsp;star is Taylor’s longest <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>romantic relationship</a> and he’s often been the inspiration for many of her recent hits, including her 2019 track “Lover.” And although they have worked together on a few songs, the former couple has been very private about <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>their relationship</a>. In fact, a year ago, Joe told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Elle&nbsp;</a>about why he and his now-ex choose to remain mostly out of the spotlight. “It’s not really [because I] want to be guarded and private, it’s more a response to something else,” he said last year. “We live in a culture that is so increasingly intrusive. The more you give and frankly, even if you don’t give it, something will be taken.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH11e5BpZq2ZqaG8s3nSsKCfrF2jxqR5w6Klp52iYn60wIypn6isn6h6t7XDnqasZZqksm6ty7Cwp2WjpbmqwI4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
