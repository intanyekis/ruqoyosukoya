For instance, it was a big deal whenever <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nickelodeon</a> or <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Disney Channel</a> showed a preview of an episode and mentioned who will be guest starring. For a premise like Nickelodeon's iCarly, guest stars have to be very interesting, whether it is a musical guest, or a fictional character who is played by a recognizable star.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'iCarly': 10 Hilarious Episodes Fans Can Never Forget About</a></span></p><p>The amount of guest stars that appeared on iCarly is extensive and amazing. Whether you recognize them from the audience cheering soundbite or not, there are fans of each actor/musician who appeared. From Emma Stone to the Plain White T's, the show starring longtime Nickelodeon actress Miranda Cosgrove offers many memorable moments thanks to these other guest stars who have also appeared in the series.</p><h2 id=michelle-obama><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Michelle Obama</span></h2><p>For the former First Lady of America to appear on iCarly, it was certainly a first that shocked watchers. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michelle Obama</a> especially works well in the episode she appeared in, titled "iMeet The First Lady." Due to Carly having a father in the Air Force, it was hard for him to head home for his birthday.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Having Obama talk about how endearing it was for Carly to care about her father and having Sam and Freddie help her out. Creator Dan Schneider even specifically wrote the episode&nbsp;with Obama involved and a feel-good initiative regarding the Joining Forces program.&nbsp;Plus, her daughters Malia and Sasha are fans of the show, so it makes sense to have her be a special guest star.</p><h2 id=david-archuleta><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>David Archuleta</span></h2><p>Despite&nbsp;being the runner-up in the seventh season of American Idol,&nbsp;David Archuleta ended up being more famous than the winner David Cook. In the iCarly world, Archuleta ended up as the show's version of American Idol, America Sings&nbsp;(even though the show&nbsp;ironically referenced it once previously in "iSpy A Mean Teacher").</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While he did not sing at all since the focus was on the gang having to deal with the notoriously awful Wade Collins, seeing Archuleta on iCarly was a cool decision. Fans will also never forget the word hobknocker because of this episode.</p><h2 id=jack-black><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Jack Black</span></h2><p>For fans that watched <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">School of Rock</a>, they were extremely pleased to see Jack Black collaborate with Cosgrove again, even if their characters did not exactly interact in the episode "iStart a Fanwar." As the genius comedian, Black portrayed a&nbsp;Aspartamay cosplayer in the World of Warcraft parody World of Warlords perfectly.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Carly, Sam, and Freddie were busy with with a shipping war at their panel, Spencer and Black's character were busy doing a fight for video game fans at the convention to spectate and enjoy. It was ironically one of the more entertaining parts of the episode, which is all thanks to Black.</p><h2 id=jane-lynch><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Jane Lynch</span></h2><p>Throughout the show, Sam's mother has been mentioned here and there, implying that she is somewhat neglectful of Sam, as she would either pursue a man or do outrageous things, but she isn't abusive physically or emotionally. So when Jane Lynch was cast to be Pam Puckett, fans were drawn in thanks to her notable role from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Glee</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The episode Lynch guest starred in features a plot line where she and Jennette McCurdy's Sam are not getting along, and Carly takes them to see a family therapist, but chaos ensues. How their characters play out each other is hilarious, but the payoff ends sweetly.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cast Of 'iCarly' Ranked By Instagram Followers</a></span></p><h2 id=james-maslow><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>James Maslow</span></h2><p>Before being one of the members of Big Time Rush and starring in the show of the same name, James Maslow appeared in the season two premiere of iCarly, where he plays Shane. Carly and Sam are drawn to him and kept bickering on who saw him first in hopes of getting the chance to date him.</p><p>In usual iCarly fashion, things don't go well for the respective parties, especially for Maslow's character. It was amazing how he managed to survive a huge fall.&nbsp;Despite his character's fate, seeing Maslow appear in a role before his big break with Big Time Rush was a nice treat.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jim-parsons><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Jim Parsons</span></h2><p>Jim Parsons as a guest star on iCarly came out of nowhere. It was just so sudden that with his The Big Bang Theory fame he would be busy with other projects. As one of the patients in the mental hospital Sam checks in after kissing Freddie, Parsons' character claims to know about the future he came from, "claiming" that Carly was going to be vice president.</p><p>While he didn't have a lot to work with since he was just a minor character in the episode, Parsons still managed to bring in laughter with his expressionless face and making obscene predictions that "happened."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=one-direction><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>One Direction</span></h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">One Direction</a> appearing on iCarly was such a big deal. The British boy band was on the rise in popularity, and the show's premiere achieved nearly four million views. When the episode was in production, the trend "We love THE iCarly cast" was one of the top results on Twitter. Creator Dan Schneider has also praised the band for their acting ability and were very fun to work with.</p><p>In a funny twist, Saturday Night Live also had an episode that featured One Direction as the musical guest, so Directioners were being fed good content&nbsp;with the band as their popularity grew.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Surprising Facts About Miranda Cosgrove After iCarly's End</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jimmy-fallon><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Jimmy Fallon</span></h2><p>SNL star and talk show host Jimmy Fallon (and to an extent Tina Fey) appeared on iCarly, and the episode in question was certainly gripping. In the episode, Fallon's show works in a live format instead of being prerecorded. With that concept, the iCarly gang appeared on Fallon's show and as they were doing Random Dancing, Gibby's pants fell down, which got them into some steep trouble.</p><p>Noah Munck, who played Gibby, has stated that Fallon was his favorite guest appearance on the show, adding that he was fun to work with and was very funny. Other than having Fallon appeared, there are many references that fans might notice depending on their knowledge of pop culture.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=emily-ratajkowski><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Emily Ratajkowski</span></h2><p>For two episodes, Emily&nbsp;Ratajkowski portrayed Tasha, Gibby's girlfriend who has Freddie shocked at how Gibby managed to find her, given how insanely gorgeous she is. After iCarly, she got more significant when she appeared in the controversial music video for Robin Thicke's "Blurred Lines."</p><p>It was a big shock that Ratajkowski went from child acting to appearing in steamy magazines and music videos. Despite that, she is a very outspoken feminist and is passionate about expressing her stance as an influential woman. To say she's come a long way is a&nbsp;serious understatement.</p><h2 id=jordan-fisher><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Jordan Fisher</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Teenage girls that watched both Disney Channel and Nickelodeon probably squealed when they saw <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jordan Fisher</a> appear on screen when watching the episode "iSpeed Date" for nostalgia's sake. He wasn't as well known as he is today, so looking back on the episode Fisher appeared in had fans surprised. He had a minor role for being Carly's first speed date, but the impact he brought on TV was impactful.</p><p>Today, Fisher is known for starring in the Disney Channel original movies Teen Beach and its sequel, Liv and Maddie, Grease: Live, and Rent: Live. Recently, he went on Broadway&nbsp; starring in Hamilton and Dear Evan Hansen. Fisher also made his film debut in&nbsp;To All the Boys: P.S. I Still Love You, the sequel to To All the Boys I Loved Before. To give credit, iCarly was the start of Fisher's career as an actor.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Has Jennette McCurdy Been Up To Since She Quit Acting</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikopuYmrmtsYyomZqlkWKur7CMcmSorJiav26vxKWcm6qZqcZus9Seqq1lo6mus7%2BMsJ%2BoZZGlvaat0Z6bZqeeYrakrdGlsGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
