She’s likely still reeling from the divorce and possible not looking to settle down.</p><p>For Yung Gravy, the rapper also doesn’t seem interested in a serious commitment. He was likely interested in romancing Sheri because she fits his brand – he’s admitted to liking older women. Many of his songs mention having a preference for “MILFs.” For example, in “Mr. Clean,” he raps, “<a href=#>I’m with your mom in the kitchen</a>, makin’ blueberry muffins.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>12 Celebrities Who Are Rumored To Be Rude IRL</a></span></p><p>Yung Gravy is also just up-and-coming in the music publicity.

It’s kissing, but it’s not real.” The insider added that Sheri isn’t the rapper’s type.
