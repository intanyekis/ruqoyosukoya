I mean, who doesn’t want a whole lot of Aldi products for free in exchange for some “helpful feedback”?</p><p>Here’s how it works</p><p>Each year the <a class=body-link href=#>Aldi Testers Club opens their doors to new members —</a> we’re told registration will reopen “sometime in 2018” so keep an eye out for it. Each member will receive a product pack containing 10 items available at Aldi, mostly pantry and other household cleaning items.</p><p>Your mission, should you chose to accept it, is to rate these items and provide a few comments on them using your special tester login online.</p><p>Review at least 50 per cent of the items sent within two months and you’re eligible for the next product pack in a few months time. Fail to meet the deadline and you’re out. It’s an exclusive club you know, and they’re brutal if you don’t show the same loyalty.</p><p>It is seriously the best job EVER</p><p>Firstly, I’d just like to say I love my job (and not just because my editor is reading this …. Hi Melissa! Very funny, Leah).</p><p>But it’s nice to get a break from bashing out letters on a keyboard to deliver all the goss from <a class=body-link href=#>royal wedding </a>and why Prince Harry has chosen to wear a wedding ring.</p><p><b>1 — You get a surprise package delivered to your doorstep</b></p><p>The Aldi team don’t really give you much of a heads up as to when you can expect your product pack to arrive apart from an email saying ‘it’s coming soon’, so you get a thrill every time your work is delivered. And I bet you don’t feel like that when your boss gives you a deadline, right?</p><p><b>2 — The whole family can join in</b></p><p>Having items in the house your family can enjoy makes writing about them a whole lot easier. The workload isn’t just on your shoulders when you can ask everyone else for their own opinion.</p><p><b>3 — You can do your work anytime in your PJ’s</b></p><p>No getting up to get dressed, no make-up, no fixing hair (read: mum bun) and no morning traffic. Writing your product reviews can be done in the comfort of your own home. On the couch, with a blankie and a cuppa. Now that’s the way I like to work.</p><p><b>4 — You have no one to answer to</b></p><p>OK sure, you’re not exactly a ‘paid employee’ but knowing you don’t have to answer to anyone apart from a little online survey robot is truly liberating. If you don’t feel like writing your reviews today, you don’t have to. #applause</p><p>As an official tester, I’ve had the chance to test a lot of products I probably wouldn’t buy, but now do because I realise they’re great. It’s fun and it’s definitely saved me some money in the long run because I know which items are great and others just meh.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb6%2FOpmWarV%2Bhtqex0q2wpZ1fp7KiuIyloJ%2BdX6OyuL%2BMpaCfnV%2Beum6tzWamn56ZmLaiuIyao52hXaW%2FsLDUnKtmrJWowaa%2BjJqlnWWZqcBuwMeeZJudo6l6q7vBZqCvnV2aw6a%2BjKGYnWeemsS0edKtpquxX2WAeLKTcZ2fcGRlhnKElJtscGySlq93gsObmW5tYmqu</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
