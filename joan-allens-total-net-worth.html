She went to Rochelle Township High School, after which she enrolled at Eastern Illinois University, where she began performing in plays alongside John Malkovich, but later she transferred to Northern Illinois University, from which she graduated with a BFA degree in Theater.</p><p>Her acting career began initially on the stage, when in 1977 she joined the Steppenwolf Theatre Company ensemble, together with Malkovich, appearing in a number of productions, such as her role of Hellen Stott in “And A Nightingale Sang”, for which she won a Clarence Derwent Award in 1984.</p><p>In the following year, she moved to the big screen, making her debut appearance in the film “Compromising Positions”, as Mary Alice Mahoney.

I know I’ve made people cry or want to slit their wrists, but to make people laugh is a very intoxicating, wonderful thing.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Acting gave me the opportunity to do outrageous things. It allowed me to be sad, happy, angry and lustful, even if it was just vicariously.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>I think there’s been a tendency to place me in what has been characterized as the “moral center” of the film. In films like The Ice Storm (1997), The Crucible (1996) and Nixon (1995), that’s the sort of the persona that emerged.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>How do we escape who we are? I think going to college, I felt freer. I loved the clean slate. I wasn’t known as the sort of nerdy, studious girl. I met gay people for the first time in my life. I needed that expansion from a very conservative little town.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>I was the good girl. The straight A student, on the honor roll, part of the choir . . . I played the cello badly. I did plays.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>I think I knew acting was what I wanted to do. But I was from this small town and there was no place for an adult to recognize it. I think the cheerleading thing was a way of performing. There was the boy element, but more important was the performance element. Once I got to high school and auditioned for a play and got in, I thought this was really what I was looking for. Once that had got cleared up, from 13 on, that was it.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>I’m hard to pin down. I tend to look different in films. I get recognized sometimes. But I just live my life. I get on the bus, I get on the subway, it’s not a problem. I think of myself more as a character actor than that ingénue leading lady, who started out something like Michelle Pfeiffer or Jessica Lange. I’m a bit quirkier than that.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Over 50% of Americans don’t agree with the administration [of President George W. Bush]; that’s a lot of people. But they don’t get the press. I know myself and my friends in New York were devastated after the last election [2004]. We could hardly stand up it was so devastating. And those are the people that I’m around a fair amount.</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>I was a very good girl for a long time, that’s what really drew me to acting. The stage was the perfect place to be outrageous, to be sad, to be angry, to be all these different things.</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>To tell you the truth, if Oliver Stone had wanted Pat Nixon to wear a G-string and swing from a chandelier, I would have played it that way.</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>I was very shy, but was desperate to meet boys. So my sister told me to be a cheerleader. I didn’t make cheerleading squad, so I thought, “Why not try out for a play?” As soon as I did I found out I absolutely loved it. I could cry and scream and laugh, but in a controlled environment.</td></tr></tbody></table><table class=interesting_facts><tbody><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>She was awarded the 1987 Drama Logue Award for Outstanding Performance for “Burn This” at the Mark Taper Forum Theatre in Los Angeles, California.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Is left-handed.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Her father was of English, German, and Scots-Irish (Northern Irish) ancestry.
