Remember Imelda Marcos and her collection of over 3,000 shoes? Women can spend an entire day shopping for shoes, and they would not mind spending a significant sum just to get the best pair possible. Christian Louboutin, Jimmy Choo and Manolo Blahnik are her closest chums, never mind that she would need to hand out as much as $4,000 just to get into one of their creations.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But if you check out the pairs of shoes listed below, then $4,000 may not really be that much. The prices may be outrageous, but some are not merely shoes. Some are borderline jewelry, while others are considered important parts of history.</p><p>Here then are the top ten most expensive shoes in the world:</p><h2 id=1-the-ruby-slippers-from-the-house-of-harry-winston---3-million><strong>1. The Ruby Slippers from the House of Harry Winston - $3 million</strong></h2><p>In 1939, Metro Goldwyn Mayer produced one of the greatest movies of all time, The Wizard of Oz.&nbsp; The film followed the adventures of Dorothy, as she seeks out the wizard of Oz in the Emerald City by following the yellow brick road while wearing her ruby slippers. The ruby slippers were sparkling with sequins.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fifty years later, Ronald Winston of the House of Harry Winston recreated the ruby slippers to celebrate the golden anniversary of the movie. But to paraphrase Dorothy, Winston had a feeling that he was not in 1939 anymore. So, instead of sequins, Winston used real rubies, 1,350 carats of it from 4,600 pieces, to be exact.&nbsp; That made the creation a truly ruby slipper.&nbsp; He also added 50 carats of diamonds for good measure. The shoes took two months to finish, and when it was finally done, the result was just over the rainbow.&nbsp; Only the movie’s lead star, Judy Garland, has gotten the honor of wearing the most expensive pair of shoes in the world.</p><h2 id=2-rita-hayworth-heels-from-stuart-weitzman---3-million><strong>2. Rita Hayworth Heels from Stuart Weitzman - $3 million</strong></h2><p>The movie Shawshank Redemption showed a prisoner using a poster with an image of Rita Hayworth to help him in his escape from prison and inspire him to maintain his sanity. Rita Hayworth did more than that. She also inspired the creation of one of the most expensive shoes in the world. Using the actress’ favorite earrings for his inspiration, Stuart Weitzman created a pair of open-toed heels of burnt sienna satin. They are decorated with diamonds, rubies and sapphires. Hayworth’s daughter, Princess Yasmin Aga Khan, owns the shoes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=3-tanzanite-heels-from-stuart-weitzman---2-million><strong>3. Tanzanite Heels from Stuart Weitzman - $2 million</strong></h2><p>This pair of shoes makes use of silver leather and platinum framing adorned with diamond and tanzanite gems. There are 28 carats of diamonds stringed on to the front straps of the heels. Embedded into the ankle bracelets are 185 carats of tanzanite gemstones. Hanging from these same ankle bracelets are a couple of gems weighing 16 carats. But the main attraction of this pair of stilettos is the heels. Imagine having 595 carats of diamonds encrusted into platinum decorating those heels!</p><h2 id=4-the-ruby-slippers-from-stuart-weitzman---1-6-million><strong>4. The Ruby Slippers from Stuart Weitzman - $1.6&nbsp;<strong>million</strong></strong></h2><p>This is another pair inspired by The Wizard of Oz. The insole is cherry red, with the upper part made of red satin that includes 642 oval and round Burma rubies. The rubies are set on a half-pound of platinum and weighs 123.33 carats.&nbsp; It was supposed to be featured during the 2003 Academy Awards, but the creators decided against it as the nation’s mood was reserved at that time due to the war in Iraq. Which was unfortunate, because a glittering ceremony in Hollywood is one of the few places where the shoes can be worn.&nbsp; I mean, can you imagine someone wearing that expensive pair in a farm in Kansas?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=5-platinum-guild-stilletos-from-stuart-weitzman---1-090-000><strong>5. Platinum Guild Stilletos from Stuart Weitzman - $1,090,000</strong></h2><p>This pair is strappy and made with platinum fabric. The stilettos are decorated with 464 round and pear-shaped Kwiat diamonds threaded together by platinum twines. The shoes are flexible, however, and can be used in any occasion. If you are attending an awards night filled with celebrities, then the shoes are perfect, as Laura Harring could attest to back in 2002. If the evening is formal but not that glittering, you can remove the diamonds, wear the shoes plainly, and convert the diamonds to jewelry instead.</p><h2 id=6-retro-rose-pumps-from-stuart-weitzman---1-000-000><strong>6. Retro Rose Pumps from Stuart Weitzman - $1,000,000</strong></h2><p>These rose pumps have a retro style from the 1940s, incorporating the i-strap that was very common during that period. Near the toe section is a pair of white roses that are actually made up of 1,800 Kwiat diamonds weighing 100 carats. The rest of the pair has around 400 Kwiat diamonds spread out all over.</p><h2 id=7-the-ruby-slippers-from-the-wizard-of-oz---666-000><strong>7. The Ruby Slippers from The Wizard of Oz - $666,000</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The original that inspired two shoes on top of the list is also included as one of the most expensive shoes in the world. The red stain shoes feature red sequins embedded into fine chiffon. A large center bow lies on top, and is edged by red glass bugle beads and three emerald-shaped crystals.</p><h2 id=8-diamond-dream-stilletos-from-stuart-weitzman---500-000><strong>8. Diamond Dream Stilletos from Stuart Weitzman - $500,000</strong></h2><p>This silver stilettos boast of high heels and 1,420 diamonds embedded in the shoes. The diamonds are set in platinum and weighs 30 carats. The pair made its debut during the 2007 Academy Awards, with actress Anika Noni modeling the shoes.</p><h2 id=9-slippers-from-nizam-sikandar-jah---160-000><strong>9. Slippers from Nizam Sikandar Jah - $160,000</strong></h2><p>Nizam Sikandar Jah ruled a state in India during the early part of the 19th century. He was born in 1768, and during this time, he had a pair of slippers that were adorned with rubies and diamonds. The slippers eventually became a symbol of 18th century royalty. No one knows the whereabouts of the slippers, however, after it got stolen from a museum.</p><h2 id=10-so-cal-air-force-1-supreme-max-from-nike---50-000><strong>10. So Cal Air Force 1 Supreme Max from Nike - $50,000</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A pair of sneakers made the list. Of course, having chocolate-colored diamonds weighing 11 carats outlining the shoes’ emblem will help spike up its price. Running has never been more luxurious.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e9OhnGasn6V6tbHNZqSoq6Risrm8xKeqoq6VYsCpu8SsZKKmXam1pnnWqKmlnF8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
