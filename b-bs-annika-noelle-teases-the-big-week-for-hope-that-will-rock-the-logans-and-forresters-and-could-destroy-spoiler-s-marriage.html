Brooke shall crap a bullfrog! If in speculation - Thomas proposes with a designed grown to Hope n proposes to her …Hope - say YES YES YES. LOVE Thomas ñ Hope together! Hot chemistry!!</p><p><span class=post-likes>4 Likes</span></p><p>About time they tied the knot. After today’s episode with them reminiscing about Rome I’m hoping they go all out and after Thomas designs Hope’s wedding gown that they make it a destination wedding in Rome. Of course unfortunately for Ridgeidiot to be able to keep TSFTVs head intact he’ll probably have to marry her a$$ again for the umpteenth time while in Rome. Preferably not butt we all know how this show is structured. For anyone, even Hope, to be front and center then TSFTV also needs her own propping up.</p><p>I hope Thomas and Hope get married, take a LONG holiday and then come back and only have scenes together. I hate watching them in the same way I hated Lope. And Thomas has been bumped off my favourites list and added to the Logan lapdog one.</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><p>Oh no a double wedding <img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/emoji.discourse-cdn.com/twitter/rofl.png title=:rofl: alt=:rofl: width=20 height=20 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> Bell would do that just so he could say the ratings were all because of Bridge</p><p><span class=post-likes>1 Like</span></p><span class=creator itemprop=author itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Person><a itemprop=url href=#><span itemprop=name>Oona68</span></a></span> <span class=crawler-post-infos>March 13, 2024, 11:01pm <span itemprop=position>8</span></span><p>I fear it’s Hope and Finn which will make me sooooooooo angry.</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><p>I would not mind a Hope and Finn union. I think that it would open Steffy eyes wide open once and for all. I don’t know what Steffy is supposed to do. Every time she gets happy Hope swoops down to make sure it only last for a short term. It’s time to change that and go in a different direction. Let Hope have Finn he is useless anyway. Let her bounce between Finn and Liam, leave Thomas out of it. Hope deserves the best pain available, give it to her.</p><p><span class=post-likes>2 Likes</span></p><p>No Italy wedding.

A very definite NO to Finn and Hope.</p><p>Finn is having some type of mental break and needs to be left right over there with Steffy…who, unfortunately, seems to also have issues.</p><p>I think I read that Steffy’s “anger” will hit new heights. Like you, I am guessing Steffy will next be stomping around messing with Hope as she demands an end to the show’s live wire couple Thomas and Hope.</p><p>I love Thomas and Hope and I really am hoping that Finn and Steffy are not able to ruin their relationship. Steffy is Thomas’s sister, not a rival girl friend. And, even if Hope says no to Thomas’s proposal, that is also none of Steffy’s concern. At least not enough of a concern that she should be belligerently getting up in anyone’s face about it.</p><p><span class=post-likes>3 Likes</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmpp2jqK6osYybppqqlKh8tXvBZpmsZZGju6q3wGalqJ2cobJuwMSaqp6rXam1pnnBop5mr5WauG6yzqtkoaegmnq1tMCtZLChnKF6s7vCpGStoJViubCzwKeqZpmemXqnu9GrnKyslafAbq3NnWScp6WhsW6wxKyrq6epYsCxu8ilnKtlo2K6or7RopignV9tf3WAk3I%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
