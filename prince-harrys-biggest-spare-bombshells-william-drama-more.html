William would become king one day, after their father, <a href=#><strong>King Charles III</strong></a>, while the former military pilot felt he was “the shadow, the support, the Plan B”<a href=#> in their family and in the country</a>.</p><p>“I was summoned to provide backup, distraction, diversion and, if necessary, a spare part. Kidney, perhaps. Blood transfusion. Speck of bone marrow,” <a href=#>the royal wrote</a>. “This was all made explicitly clear to me from the start of life’s journey and regularly reinforced after.”</p><p>While feeling less than his sibling was par for the course in Harry’s life, <a href=#>it spawned countless heated arguments</a> to transpire between the two brothers growing up.</p><p>Harry detailed one particularly brutal physical fight with William in the book over his wife, <a href=#><strong>Meghan Markle</strong></a>, and claimed that the Prince of Wales <a href=#>took issue with his appearance ahead of their marriage</a>.</p><p>“I showed up to my stag ready to party. To laugh, to have a good time, to get clear of all this stress,” <a href=#>the BetterUp CIO</a> wrote, referring to his bachelor party in 2018. “And yet I also feared that if I got too clear, got too drunk and passed out, Willy and his mates would hold me down and shave me.”</p><p>He alleged that his brother was not a fan of his beard pre-wedding, so he was ready to force it from his face. “In fact Willy told me, explicitly, in all seriousness, that this was his plan,” Harry continued. “So, while having fun, I was also at all times keeping my older brother in my sight.”</p><p>While his <a href=#>tension with William</a> was a big part of the book, Harry also recalled his own personal highs and lows, including drug use and <a href=#>the way in which he lost his virginity</a>.</p><p>Elsewhere in the memoir, the duke opened about his true feelings toward stepmother <a href=#><strong>Queen Consort Camilla</strong></a>, who married his father in 2005. He also identified how his mother, <a href=#>Princess Diana</a>, has remained <a href=#>a guiding light throughout his life</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Scroll down to see the biggest <a href=#>bombshells from Harry’s Spare memoir</a>:</p><p>Spare hits bookshelves on Tuesday, January 10.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkvbO1zZycZqCRp7%2B6v4yboKCflajBbr%2FPmqmeZZKkuqO%2Fx56jpatdrLatuMiapGacopa6onnMqKmeZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
