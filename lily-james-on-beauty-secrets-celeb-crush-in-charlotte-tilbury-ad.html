Well, the star relies on an unexpectedly shocking treatment. “Shove your face in a bucket of ice or a sink full of ice water and it just sort of tightens everything,” James says. Once that’s sorted, she “obviously just slathers on the Magic Cream,” the Charlotte Tilbury product <a href=#>that launched her relationship as brand face</a>.</p><p>The Pam and Tommy star also reveals that her Hollywood beauty icon is <strong>Brigitte Bardot</strong>, but at a very specific time. She loves the iconic French actress’ look “in the ‘50s and ‘60s, when she would always have this amazing eyeliner and this incredible blonde hair.”</p><p>As for her celebrity crush, the British beauty also taps into a past era. “My forever Hollywood crush is <strong>Montgomery Cliff</strong>, [he’s] just so unbelievably dark and brooding and handsome… and an amazing actor,” she gushes. “And recently for a role, I was watching all these movies from the 1950s with <strong>Ava Gardner</strong> and <a href=#><strong>Liz Taylor</strong></a> and <strong>Richard Burton</strong> and I just got so swept away!”</p><p>To hear more of the star’s deep thoughts — including a rapid-fire Would You Rather — watch the video below!</p><p>James’ smooth talk in the film is quite apropos, as the newly-launched <a href=#>Hollywood Glow Glide Face Architect Highlighter</a> gives the complexion a seriously silky sheen. Available in seven shades from a luminous ivory (Pearl Glow) to pearly pink (Pillow Talk Glow) and sumptuous sun-kissed bronze (Bronze Glow, sold exclusively at <a href=#>charlottetilbury.com</a>), hues can be used as highlighter to add dimension to high points or as contour to sculpt angles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Lily-James-Charlotte-Tilbury-campaign-2.jpg><p>The product was inspired by the lighting tricks of Old Hollywood. A high-tech formula boasts gel-wrapped pigments that diffuse light to blur imperfections, leaving a your-skin-only-better soft-focus, seemingly filtered finish.</p><p>Of course, this is not the first genius brainchild of <strong>Charlotte Tilbury</strong>, the makeup maven behind Hollywood’s A-list including <a href=#><strong>Salma Hayek</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Penelope Cruz</strong></a>,<a href=#><strong> Kate Moss</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Amal Clooney</strong></a> and more. Famous for her Magic Cream that acts as a moisturizer and primer for makeup as well as the Pillow Talk range of products that recreate the look of love, <a href=#>Hollywood Glow Glide Face Architect Highlighter</a> joins the roster of sure-to-become celebrity cult favorites. $48 each, <a href=#>charlottetilbury.com</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6G2rcWMo5imnaNivK95wZ6YrqypYsCmr9Geq6xlk5q5pq6MnKmuq5hitq95wqGYq6SfqcGmedOio5utoq56orCO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
