"So I saw an ad that said, 'We do a Pap smear and give you red glasses.'"</p><p>When Raphael visited the advertised medical office offering the bizarre deal, they tried to convince her to spring for a more expensive pair of frames.&nbsp; "They were going to trade me up [to a better pair]," she admitted on&nbsp; Oprah.&nbsp; "I said: 'You're not going to trade me up. I don't have that kind of money.' It's all they had for $19.95."</p><p>For her Oprah chat, Raphael appeared alongside fellow retired talk show greats<strong> Phil Donahue, Ricki Lake, Geraldo Rivera</strong> and <strong>Montel Williams</strong>; the group reminisced about their friendly rivalry with Winfrey and one another, and offered her advice on the impending end of her show.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>How has Raphael spent her post-TV retirement? She's traveled the world and spent time on her 18th-century farm in New York state with her husband Karl and their chickens, cats and horses.</p><p>Despite that lovely life, Raphael admits to getting antsy without the daily grind of a talk show. "It was two weeks–great, I don't have to get up. And then it was seven years–why doesn't anybody call me?" she said. "So I'm doing a show now about a talk show host who is asked to leave the air and what happens to her after that."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKqapJyuequx0qywZqqRpbWisctmnLGonJa2r7%2BMoZyrZZaWurDB0mapnpxdnLmiv9KeqmZqYGZ9cnyQamY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
