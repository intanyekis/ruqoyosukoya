Records reveal the controversial heavy metal artist, who recently sold his longtime Hollywood Hills home for $1.8 million, has dropped about $2.2 million for a secluded property in nearby Glendale. The new house had been listed for just under $2 million.</p><p><span class=related-single><b>RELATED: </b><a href=#><b>Once Worth $25 Million, Marilyn Manson Is On The Verge Of Going Broke</b></a></span></p><p>According to <a href=#><i>Dirt</i></a>, Built in the 1960s and recently “lovingly restored,” per the listing, the midcentury structure was sold to Manson by prolific songwriter Jeremy Ruzumna (DaBaby’s “Kirk,” Macy Gray’s “I Try,” Bruno Mars’ “The Other Side”). Ruzumna himself bought the place only last year, paying $1.6 million; a quick photo comparison reveals he made a handful of small updates to the property. The most significant of those changes was converting the detached two-car garage into a professional recording studio, complete with soundproof walls, an amenity that no doubt appealed to Manson.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Quietly secluded down an out-of-the-way lane in the Glendale foothills, and set atop a knoll behind a long driveway, the home feels a world apart from the bustling city of Los Angeles. Inside the boxy residence are four bedrooms and three baths spread across two levels totaling just over 2,000 square feet of living space. A steep staircase leads up to the double front doors, which open into a narrow but double-height foyer; at a far end of the hall lies a light-flooded living room with hardwood floors and a lava rock fireplace.</p><p>Other highlights include open-concept family and dining areas, a wooden balcony ideal for al fresco dining and a fully renovated kitchen with Viking appliances, bespoke cabinetry and custom quartz waterfall island.</p><p>All four of the home’s bedrooms appear to be located on the upper floor, and at least one of them offers an ensuite bathroom. Big windows offer views of the numerous ancient oaks that surround the entire property, wrapping the house and recording studio in a forest of green. Multiple wooden terraces and patios provide a more up-close look at the trees, and though much of the hillside lot is steeply sloped, there’s also a flat patch of grassy lawn located behind the recording studio.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now well into his 50s, Manson’s career arguably peaked in the mid 1990s with his eponymous band’s “Antichrist Superstar” and the subsequent “Mechanical Animals” albums. In 2021, “Westworld” star Evan Rachel Wood and multiple other women accused the shock rocker of psychological and sexual abuse.</p><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT</b><a href=#><b>: Luka Doncic Rookie Card Sold For $3.12 Million At Auction</b></a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Dirt</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmaanqSav26tjJugnZyZo7Ruw8CrZKaZop65urqMppinq5%2Bjeqe1zZqjpbFdpcKzr8eaqp6cXZy5prrDmqOeZaSnsqa0zq6qnmWnnsGpedGemqiqlJ67qHnSraydoZ9is7C%2BjGtka2Wdnrmttc6nZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
