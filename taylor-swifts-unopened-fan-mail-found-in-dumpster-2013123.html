The 23-year-old Grammy winner receives countless pieces of fan mail each week from around the world â€” but over the weekend, a huge stockpile of said mail was discovered, unopened, laying in a dumpster in Swift's hometown of Nashville, Tenn. Local Kaylee Francescan discovered the motherlode of ignored letters "covered with pictures, hearts and sparkles" while throwing out the trash.</p><p>"There were like hundreds of letters in there to Taylor Swift and I'm like, 'Oh my gosh!' I didn't know if they were stolen [or] discarded, so I threw them in a box," Francescan told ABC Nashville station <a href=#>WKRN</a>. "And I'm like, 'Somebody needs to let Taylor know,' It did bother me [because] I know how much her fans mean to her."</p><p>The fan mail is typically sent to a P.O. Box at a Nashville strip mall, with a member of the chart-topper's team fetching the mail regularly. Thankfully, it was simply a clerical error, Swift's rep tells <a href=#>Us Weekly.</a></p><p>"A small batch of mail that was supposed to be delivered to Taylor was accidentally put with letters headed for the recycling center," the rep explains.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Indeed, Swift's gratitude towards her fans is well known. "It blows me away how thoughtful and organized they are," Swift has said. "Sometimes they'll give me a scrapbook or a project that was made by hundreds of fans from around the world."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatmamhvLN50rCgn6yjYsKvu8%2BepZ6cXZuur3nMmqClZZakwq%2BwjKKlZpylor20wMSrZGtoYWh%2Bc3%2BO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
