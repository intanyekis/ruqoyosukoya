He was one of the first PayPal employees and was later joined by other employees like Steve Chen and Chad Hurley.</p><p>In the year 2005, he created a video-sharing website name YouTube along with Steve Chen and Chad Hurley. Karim also then designed and implemented several core components of PayPal. One of them includes a real-time anti-fraud system.</p><p>Karim explained that he was inspired to develop the website when he didn’t find the video clips of two events easily. The clips that he was searching for were the clips of the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy involving Janet Jackson and that of the Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. Both these events/incidents happened in 2004.</p><p>On 14 February 2005, working more, the site gradually developed in the next few months activating the domain name YouTube.

The video has already garnered over 54.6 million views while his channel has over 354 K subscribers.</p><p>After the creation and development of Youtube with Chen and Hurley, Karim became an adviser of the company. At the same time, he gave continuity to his studies. In February 2005, Karem became an informal adviser for the company. As he was also studying, he didn’t work as an employee on YouTube.

At the time, Karim received 137,443 shares of stock, which amounted to around $64 million.

Moreover, in 2007, Karim became the youngest Commencement Speaker in the history of the University of Illinois.</p><p>He was the 136th person to deliver a commencement speech at that university at that time. Karim’s articles on programming have been published in&nbsp;Dr. Dobb’s Journal&nbsp;(DDJ) in the United Business Media US monthly journal.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Youniversity_Ventures></span>Youniversity Ventures<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Karim alongside Keith Rabois and Kevin Hart launched a venture<span>&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">fund</a>. </span>They named it Youniversity Ventures which is now known as YVentures.</p><p>Likely, in April 2009,&nbsp;he was one of the first investors to invest in&nbsp;Airbnb Inc&nbsp;which runs an online marketplace and hospitality service.
