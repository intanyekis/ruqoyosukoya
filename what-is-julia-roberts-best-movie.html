She went on to win more hearts with her performances in a number of blockbuster rom-com movies. <a href=#>Fans say she has a magic touch, which is why she's been so successful</a>, and it may just be true. Even though she stepped away from romantic movies for more than 2 decades, she remains the most popular actress in the style.
