The cast has changed a lot over the years, but some popular fan favorites remained, creating their stardom in the Bravo universe. What was once a reality show about a group of close friends who spent their summers in New York's Montauk, turned into a dramatic reality series that became more hilariously entertaining each summer. Nowadays, the cast are "Bravolebrities" in their own right and have made plenty of money from the show. There are even rumors about <a href=#>a reality TV wedding</a> between Carl Radke & Lindsay Hubbard. From <a href=#>signing personal contracts on the reality show</a>&nbsp;that showcase their worth to spinoffs, these Bravolebrities are powerful.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's hard to believe that the&nbsp;Summer House cast gets paid to showcase their friendships, especially when partying hard, but their unique bond and ups and downs are what Bravo fans can't get enough of. And while their salaries aren't widely known, these cast members get paid good money to show off their hot, dramatic summers.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Net Worth Of 'The Real Housewives Of Salt Lake City', Ranked</a></span></p><h2 id=summer-house-veterans-get-paid-more-than-newbies>Summer House Veterans Get Paid More Than Newbies</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/The-cast-of-Summer-House-partying-on-a-bus.jpg> Bravo TV<p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Life and Style Magazine</a>, along with other sources, shared that the salaries of those on Summer House haven’t been fully disclosed, but comparing the series to other series on Bravo, it’s presumed they make anywhere from $10,000 to $20,000 an episode. With 10-17 episodes in a season, the cast could presumably make upwards of $100,000-$170,000 per season.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Other Bravo shows like The Real Housewives&nbsp;can make millions off a season, but Summer House hasn’t quite hit that benchmark yet. However, it’s one of the network’s more successful shows because it spiraled into a spin-off, Winter House. While it's not the <a href=#>highest-grossing reality TV show</a>,&nbsp;Summer House's cast is successful.&nbsp;Summer House stars like Kyle Cooke, Lindsay Hubbard, Carl Radke, and Amanda Batula have all been with the series from the start, which could presumably mean they make the most per episode. At the same time, cast members like Paige DeSorbo and Andrea Denver have only made the series better and have been concrete characters. However, since Summer House isn’t the cast’s main source of income, their net worths are even higher because their sole job isn't reality TV.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rookie-summer-house-members>Rookie Summer House members</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/The-cast-of-Summer-House-partying-outside.jpg> Bravo TV<p>Longtime cast members presumably earn more per episode than those who lasted one season. Not only do they earn more per episode, but their fame has led them to earn more in promotions, endorsements, and other career ventures. Moreover, the entire premise of the show is that this group of friends works hard during the week for their day jobs and then lets loose on the weekends in the Hamptons. Because of their fame from Bravo, their careers outside of the show have skyrocketed.</p><p>Husband and wife duo, Kyle Cooke and Amanda Batula, own and market their own adult beverage company, Lover Boy. Lover Boy is consistently marketed and shown in the show, which only made fans more curious about the brand. With so many hard canned drinks on the market, it’s astounding the couple was able to earn $38 million in sales in 2022, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Business Insider</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=other-ventures-of-the-stars>Other Ventures Of The Stars</h2><p>Another successful star on&nbsp;Summer House is Paige DeSorbo who created a lifestyle brand of sorts on social media. As an influencer, she's worked with everyone from Amazon to The Drop. Andrea Denver, on the same hand, is a male model who has&nbsp;a net worth of $1.5 million, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a>. The same can be said for Lindsay Hubbard who owned her own public relations company, and Ciara Miller who is both a nurse and a model. Any way a viewer slices it,&nbsp;Summer House has some of the most successful stars.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>2021 Celebrity Alcohol Brands</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the past, rookie&nbsp;Summer House members&nbsp;who only lasted a season or two got their foot in the door and expanded&nbsp;their fandom to benefit careers outside of TV. This includes Hannah Berner who now has a career in comedy on top of being the cohost of a podcast with DeSorbo. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Things</a>, Berner's net worth is upwards of $500,000 — and that's large in part of her popularity in the series.&nbsp;While being a cast member on&nbsp;Summer House is impressive, it's the consistent cast members who bring in the bucks.</p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lover Boy</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS1pr7ErGShp6diuravx2abqJ2jYsGpsYycmKysXaSzbr%2FUpqSeql2dvLa%2FxGakmqOVZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
