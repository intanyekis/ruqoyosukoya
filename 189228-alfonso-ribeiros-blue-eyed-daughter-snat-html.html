The affair also included her mother, Angela Ribeiro and brothers, AJ, 5, and Anders, 4. The host of “America’s Funniest Home Videos” thanked the cruise liner for their wonderful experience which included a stingray sighting close to the shore. He<a class="ie l" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/B7HlMBAhXfZ/> quoted</a> his boys in one of his posts saying it was “the best adventure and coolest time ever.”</p><p class=Xg>But the highlight of the trip appeared to be Ava’s presence which clearly made it extra memorable. Though she’s months away from turning one, the little girl enjoyed her time and pleased her parents.</p><p class=Xg>Like Alfonso, Angela posted a photo of Ava on the same day showing her sucking her thumbs. Her wide blue eyes were captivating as she sat on her father’s lap. Angela captioned the pic, “Just some blue-eyed cuteness for your Saturday feed.”</p><p class=Xg>Alfonso and Angela <a class="ie l" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/alfonso-ribeiro-welcomes-daughter-ava-sue/>welcomed Ava in May</a>, their first and most likely last daughter together apart from Alfonso’s 16-year-old daughter, Sienna from a previous relationship. The actor admitted to Access’s Mario Lopez back in November that they were <a class="ie l" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://bckonline.com/2019/11/05/alfonso-ribeiro-and-his-wife-are-done-with-having-kids/>done having kids</a>. “My program has ended,” he had <a class="ie l" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jXX-bEag6I&amp=&t=27s">said</a>. “We not playing no more.”</p><p class=Xg>It’s crazy in his household as it is, according to the “Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” alum who admitted to <a class="ie l" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/alfonso-ribeiro-love-with-daughter-ava/>People</a> that his two boys can be quite a handful. They would literally climb walls, he recounts.</p><p class=Xg>But they love their sister dearly because she’s basically a happy baby who likes to smile a lot and communicate. The doting dad <a class="ie l" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/parents/alfonso-ribeiro-love-with-daughter-ava/>calls</a> her a “sweetheart” and gushes over how perfect she is.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmpvcmpibXqiuMWopaynXae2o7HIq6asZZKhwqZ5xLKcnWWUlsKotNOeqWarnpbBb7TTpqM%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
