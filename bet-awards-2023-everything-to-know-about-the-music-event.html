We look forward to paying tribute to the pioneers and innovators as we amplify the new generation of hip-hop artists like only BET can.”</p><p>Earlier this month, BET revealed the list of nominees for this year’s event, including music, television, film and sports categories that are all pegged to “abundant creative expression and Black excellence,” per the network.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Drake</strong></a>, who has won 15 trophies at the awards show over the years, <a href=#>tops the 2023 list with seven nods</a>.

The <a href=#>“Lemonade” songstress</a>, 41, is nominated for Album of the Year, Best Female R&B/Pop Artist, Viewer’s Choice Award and the BET Her Award.</p><p>On June 15, the network <a href=#>unveiled the first round of performers</a>, confirming that singers from both the East and West Coast will entertain the crowd.</p><p><strong>Fat Joe</strong>, <strong>Soulja Boy</strong>, <strong>The Sugarhill Gang</strong>, <a href=#><strong>Tyga</strong></a>, <strong>Ying Yang Twins</strong> and <strong>Yo-Yo</strong> are just a few acts that viewers can expect to take the stage.</p><p>“We have an incredible lineup of performers who will take us on a musical journey, covering hip-hop spanning every decade, style, and region,” Orlando said in a press release. “This wall-to-wall party will reverberate with the amazing energy and passion these artists bring to the stage and the culture. Prepare for an unforgettable night of reunions and surprises as we celebrate hip-hop’s rich history, enduring legacy, and promising future.”</p><p>Ahead of Sunday’s event, the BET Awards have been the No. 1 cable awards show among adults 18 to 49 in both 2021 and 2022.
