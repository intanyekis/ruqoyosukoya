The<i> Sports Illustrated </i>model, 24, told <i>Glamour </i>magazine that when she first started modeling, she was told to lose weight “all the time.”</p><p><span>“At first I tried to diet to become their image, but eventually I realized that it wasn’t realistic — that this is just the shape of my body,” the October 2016 cover girl recalled to the mag. “So I had to block them out. I think that the people who are the loudest about wanting to change you are the people with the least amount of vision and creativity.”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kate-upton-cover-eb601302-cf33-4a45-b41e-e0baf16963e8.jpg><p>Upton said that body shamers are still present in her day-to-day life, especially on social media, but she doesn’t let it get to her.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><span>“In the beginning it was so hurtful,” t</span><span>he</span><i> Other Woman</i><span> actress admitted. “But I have to say, the other day I was reading some negative comments, and I was thinking they were really funny. So I guess they don’t [bother me] anymore.”</span></p><p>In fact, her whole approach to her body has changed, especially when it comes to working out.</p><p>“A couple of years ago, there was a switch for me,” Upton explained. “I used to work out to have my hips be a certain size. Now I do it for myself, because I want to be strong. I want to have energy. In my mind I feel like I can beat someone up — I really want to be able to do it! Oh, and I want a nice butt, and if it’s a quarter inch bigger than the modeling-world standard, that’s fine.”</p><span class=caption></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGakmaSaera806ilZq%2BRqHq1u8udZK2nXaG8tLGMsJyin5ipeqK4y2aroZ1dqbausYywa2xwY2l9cA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
