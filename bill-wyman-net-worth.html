During his early career, he went by the stage name "Lee’ Wyman" but later on changed it to Bill in commemoration to a close friend with whom he had served at the Air Force with between 1955 and 1957. His solo albums include "Monkey Grip", "Stuff", "Bill Wyman" and "Stone Alone". He also has a collaborative album done with Mickey Gee, Charlie Watts and others.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom
