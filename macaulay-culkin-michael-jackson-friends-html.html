They became&nbsp;friends after Culkin shot to fame after the first Home Alone movie in 1990. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Three years later, all hell broke loose for Jackson after he was accused of child sexual abuse. As this pertained to children, and as Culkin was still a child, he was naturally dragged into the legal case that ran for years.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>There have been many speculations about whether Jackson and Culkin were only friends or if there was something more between them. So, what was their relationship, exactly? <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Macaulay Culkin and Michael Jackson’s Early Friendship</h2><p>As mentioned above, Culkin and Jackson became fast friends after his rise to fame. Home Alone came first, followed by Culkin's appearance on Jackson's 1991 controversial hit 'Black or White.' <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p></p><p><strong>Macaulay Culkin alongside Michael Jackson in his 1991 'Black or White' video.</strong><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span> (Photo: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Twitter</a>) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>In 1991, Culkin and Jackson would go on a vacation with another family. Brock Goldstein and Culkin, both 10 years old at the time, struck up a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">friendship after meeting</a> on a movie set. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Brock asked his parents if Culkin could join their vacation, and they agreed. But they did not know Culkin had invited Jackson to the vacation as well.</p><p>Jackson showed up in Bermuda <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">two days later</a>, and when asked why he joined them on the vacation, he said he "just [needed] a break." They had fun during the trip, and Jackson made sure the family had as much privilege as they could in the resort they were at, all&nbsp;expenses paid. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>But, after the 1993 child sexual abuse cases hit the court and the news, this vacation and Jackson's intentions were heavily scrutinized. The Goldstein family, however, maintained the pop star did nothing improper during the vacation — Culkin and Brock had their own rooms, and Jackson had his own.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Brock, in a 2009 interview, said Jackson was "just like one of [them]."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>"It makes perfect sense to me because he never had a childhood. Obviously he's not normal. He had a twisted upbringing," he added. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The case was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">highly sensationalized</a> by the media, which&nbsp;resorted to misleading reporting of the case. One of these hit-pieces brought up Culkin's name, and he became one of the first names everyone brought up while talking about Jackson's alleged misdoings. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>Macaulay Culkin Denied Michael Jackson Abused Him</h2><p>After the witch hunt began, Jackson's many employees, as well as the media, started making up lies about how the pop sensation had abused Culkin. Many started asking for money in exchange for false admissions regarding how Jackson had sexually touched the child actor or made sexual advances.</p><p>Culkin, however, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">denied all these</a>. In May 2005, during his court appearance for the case, he said the allegations were "absolutely ridiculous" and things that were alleged "never" happened. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He admitted&nbsp;he had slept on Jackson's bed in his Neverland Ranch more than a dozen times between when he was nine and 14, but that it was all "good old fun." He denied getting molested or sexually touched, even when they slept together.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p dir=ltr lang=en>Macaulay Culkin is godfather to Paris Jackson.

They had a final exchange in the bathroom of the courthouse where the singer, according to the actor, denied a longer conversation because he did not want to influence his testimony.</p><p>Culkin <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">attended</a> Jackson's 2009 funeral with his <a href=# rel=follow>then-girlfriend, Mila Kunis</a>, but his relationship with the Jacksons did not end with his death.
