Not to mention, they have the money to hire event planners whose job it is to make sure blunders don’t happen. The only things they usually have to worry about is keeping the paparazzi out of the event and posting photos before the wedding is even over. So, all and all, you would have to assume they could have their dream wedding just the way they like it. Well, if you thought that, then you would be wrong, in some cases anyway.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It doesn’t seem to matter who you are; wedding disasters can happen to anyone. There are just some things that we can’t control and it appears as if it’s the same thing for celebrities. Sometimes, freak accidents or mishaps will occur that most people wouldn’t even expect to happen. There are just some things that can’t be avoided. When it comes to wedding disasters, these celebrities are just like us.</p><p>Just because something bad happens on your wedding day, it doesn’t mean the whole day is ruined. It’s all how you handle the situation and it’s always best to let things roll off your shoulders. Some of these celebrities didn’t last very long after the wedding and maybe those mishaps were a sign, while there are others that are still together to this day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=blake-lively-and-ryan-reynolds><strong>Blake Lively And Ryan Reynolds</strong></h2><p>It’s seriously hard not to love these two. They are such a fun couple and have been married for almost seven years. Blake Lively had more than a little mishap at her wedding to Ryan Reynolds; the stunning actress burnt her wedding dress. She told Vogue magazine, “They brought out these sparklers, and I’m watching her sing. I look down and my wedding dress has a big burn from one of the sparklers. Right on the front! And it was just so heartbreaking to me.” Ryan was there to save the day, though. “Later, my dress was hanging up and Ryan said, ‘Isn’t that beautiful?’ I said, ‘What?’ And he pointed to the burn. My heart just stopped, because it was such a sensitive little subject. And he said, ‘You’ll always remember that moment with Florence singing and the sparklers. You have that forever, right there, preserved.’ Now that’s my favorite part of the dress.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=hilary-duff-and-mike-comrie><strong>Hilary Duff And Mike Comrie</strong></h2><p>If you haven’t seen Hilary Duff’s wedding dress, you are missing out. When it comes to celebrity weddings, these people go all out. Duff married NHL pro athlete Mike Comrie and the two have been in love ever since. Duff’s disaster happened first thing in the morning before the wedding even happened. She was eating a bagel for breakfast when a tooth came out. She told Ellen DeGeneres while on her show, “I started laughing at myself and then I really burst into tears.” But like we said, these celebrities have teams helping them on their day and thankfully she had celeb wedding planner Mindy Weiss to save the day. She called in one of her connections and had Duff in to see a dentist so that her smile was perfect for the day.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jessica-simpson-and-eric-johnson><strong>Jessica Simpson And Eric Johnson</strong></h2><p>Jessica Simpson has been married a couple of times. Her marriage with Nick Lachey was famously documented on reality TV, but we’re pretty sure she learned not to do that again. When it came to the wedding of Jessica Simpson and Eric Johnson, it was Simpson that made a blunder. She said she was so nervous during her nuptials, she said the wrong name when it came to saying, “I do.” Doesn’t that sound like a Friends&nbsp;episode? Thankfully, the name she said wasn’t another guy’s, but it was her own name. Simpson didn’t let it get her down, though, and she just went with the flow. She laughed off the flub, shrugged, and started over. It’s really the best thing that you can do and if anything, it probably lightened the mood for everyone.</p><h2 id=katherine-heigl-and-josh-kelley><strong>Katherine Heigl And Josh Kelley</strong></h2><p>Katherine Heigl and Josh Kelley got married in 2007 and the two are still together. In fact, these days, Heigl is still gushing about him. For some reason, Kelley thought it would be a great idea to go skiing a few days before the wedding even though he hadn’t skied in years. The trip resulted in him having a broken nose. Heigl told SheKnows, “He hadn’t skied in years. I said, ‘I don’t think you should ski,’ and he said, ‘No, I’m a good skier — I’ll be fine.’ That day, of course, he broke his nose going over a jump because he was showing off! I was like, ‘I told you so!'” If that wasn’t bad enough, they also had to cancel the honeymoon to Mexico because Heigl forgot to bring her passport to the airport.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kim-kardashian-and-kanye-west><strong>Kim Kardashian And Kanye West</strong></h2><p>These two were expected to put on a party that would not be soon forgotten. After all, the both of them love attention and being in the spotlight. Their wedding cost a whopping $3 million . They wanted to have plenty of marble in their wedding, that’s how lavish it was. Oddly enough, though, they didn’t have a guestbook or place cards like most people do at weddings. They allowed their guests to carve their names into their marble reception table which is bizarre, to say the least. The problem with that is that many names were misspelled, they weren’t sure of the guests who didn’t show up, so it made rearranging guests quite difficult. They also ordered a few marble statues that arrived damaged which did not please the bride. They probably should have avoided marble altogether.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=troian-bellisario-and-patrick-j-adams><strong>Troian Bellisario And Patrick J. Adams</strong></h2><p>These two met on the popular TV show Pretty Little Liars. They fell in love and it wasn’t long before they were saying “I do.” The two got married in California, but despite all their planning, they did not avoid wedding disasters. They&nbsp;used a school bus instead of a limo for their wedding party&nbsp;and maybe that was their first mistake; the second would be allowing the groom to drive it. But Bellisario said he had to drive it “because he’s Patrick,” which probably means like most guys he has that childlike quality about him. Unfortunately for everyone, the bus got stuck and all the men had to get out and push the bus in their suits. Their teamwork came through because they all made it back to the wedding. What a relief that must have been.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kristin-cavallari-and-jay-cutler><strong>Kristin Cavallari And Jay Cutler</strong></h2><p>The Hills star Kristen Cavallari married Chicago Bears quarterback Jay Cutler in 2013. Oddly, this is the second attempt for the two to get married. They originally called off their wedding because things weren’t working out for them, but they eventually decided to go to couple’s therapy and the second attempt at getting married sealed the deal. She told Wake Up With Taylor radio show, “One 100 per cent, I think therapy saved our relationship. I realized why I react certain ways to certain things, and you learn great tools for communication, which is the most important thing I think.” On the day of the wedding, however, Cavallari was bitten by her own dog and was left with an open wound. It was so bad, the makeup artist had to glue the wound closed so that she would look good for her wedding day.</p><h2 id=audrina-patridge-and-corey-bohan><strong>Audrina Patridge And Corey Bohan</strong></h2><p>Another star from&nbsp;The Hills had a mishap on her wedding day. The two had a Hawaiian wedding in 2016 and the two couldn’t have looked more in love. Audrina has stated about her wedding that "sometimes you have to roll with the punches!" Patridge lost her veil while she was walking down the aisle. It was a small wardrobe malfunction because her veil got caught on a wooden pole between the seats. "I kept moving forward with a smile on my face until it came off!" Patridge wrote on her blog. "I continued walking until some very generous friends ran up behind me to secure it back on my head." Good thing people came to help her out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cameron-diaz-and-benji-madden><strong>Cameron Diaz And Benji Madden</strong></h2><p>We don’t know much about Cameron Diaz and Benji Madden because they keep their private life and their relationship very private. We are aware of their wedding mishap however, and it involved the best man. During their 2015 wedding, the best man, Joel Madden, was bringing the rings to the groom when he dropped them in front of everyone. That wasn’t the end of it, however. Diaz had plans on changing her dress throughout the wedding but could not get out of the first one. She had to call in her stylist to help her escape. Their wedding song was a disaster because the lighting team couldn't get anything right. The couple had to scream, “just push the off button.” All this can be embarrassing when you have a room full of A-listers like Drew Barrymore, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Reese Witherspoon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=john-legend-and-chrissy-teigen><strong>John Legend And Chrissy Teigen</strong></h2><p>Don’t we all just love cocktail hour at weddings? It’s a great way to mingle and meet new people all while having some champagne. At John Legend and Chrissy Teigen’s wedding, however, cocktail hour lasted a whopping four hours. They're really lucky their guests weren’t hammered before dinner was served. The reason for the huge delay was that it was an outdoor wedding and the weather was horrible. All things considered, though, it wasn’t the worst thing that could happen on their wedding day. The wedding would have just gone on longer than expected and who doesn’t love a long party, especially when it’s an extravagant one. “Weather delayed our wedding for hours. They had cocktails for four hours!” Teigen told Weddings about her guests. We can just imagine what they were like on the dance floor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kym-johnson-and-robert-herjavec><strong>Kym Johnson And Robert Herjavec</strong></h2><p>Kym Johnson and Robert Herjavec met when they were dance partners on Dancing With the Stars. The two really hit it off on the show and off. It was practically love at first sight and the next thing we knew they were walking down the aisle. When it comes to weddings, as beautiful as it looks, sometimes candles just aren’t the thing to have. During their wedding, Johnson’s Monique Lhuillier dress passed over the flame of a candle and caught on fire. Now that must have been terrifying. "We smelled something and we thought, is someone having a barbecue?" Herjavec told People. "Then we realized that Kym's dress was on fire!" The&nbsp;man of honor&nbsp;of&nbsp;was the one to save the day and stamped out the flames. It looks like Blake Lively wasn’t the only one that barbecued her dress.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=casey-wilson-and-david-caspe><strong>Casey Wilson And David Caspe</strong></h2><p>Casey Wilson from Happy Endings married the creator of the show David Caspe. Everything about the wedding was beautiful if only Wilson had avoided the dance floor. Her moves were just a little too much for her because she ended up damaging both of her knees. Wilson told Martha Stewart Weddings, “The next day, I could not extend either of my legs. We were going to Italy, and my new husband was wheeling me through the airport. We were just laughing.” Wilson&nbsp;did a lot of growing up over the years as she recognized her anger issues. “I started realizing my outbursts were causing real problems. I was not asked back to Saturday Night Live. My long-term relationship ended poorly.” She added that she now understands the moment “between feeling and action” a lot better and she “found joy in (her) work,” but added, “I’m still an angry bird, to be sure.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=solange-knowles-and-alan-ferguson><strong>Solange Knowles And Alan Ferguson</strong></h2><p>When it comes to your wedding day, you want everything to be perfect and that includes your skin. Brides especially put a lot into their appearances for their wedding because there are going to be pictures and video. When it came to the wedding of Beyoncé’s little sister Solange, things didn’t start off on the right foot. The poor girl woke up&nbsp;with pimples on her face&nbsp;and it could have had a lot to do with stress or nerves on the wedding day.&nbsp;Thankfully, there are good makeup artists in the world and Solange was able to cover it up. What made matters worse was that she broke out into hives near the end of&nbsp;the day, so things were just a little difficult for her. That’s the marvelous thing about makeup these days; there isn’t anything it can’t cover.</p><h2 id=ginnifer-goodwin-and-josh-dallas><strong>Ginnifer Goodwin And Josh Dallas</strong></h2><p>We were all pretty happy when Ginnifer married her real-life Prince Charming, Josh Dallas. The two met on Once Upon a Time where they played married characters Snow White and Prince Charming. When it came to their wedding day, it wasn’t the fairytale they expected. They got a call from their wedding planner that morning and she gave the couple some bad news. “We hired a wedding planner to help us and she called me crying on the morning of our wedding," Goodwin told Kimmel. "She said, 'My car has been robbed.'" Ginnifer wasn’t fazed because she thought, “What could be in the car that actually would matter?" It turned out that the wedding planner left their Jewish wedding contract made by artists and written in Hebrew in the car. Luckily enough, the contract was eventually found by Hebrews who were able to read it and figure out who’s it was and get it back to them in time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=freddie-prinze-jr-and-sarah-michelle-gellar><strong>Freddie Prinze Jr. And Sarah Michelle Gellar</strong></h2><p>This celebrity couple must be doing something right because they have been married now for 15 years! That’s an eternity by Hollywood standards so they must know what they are doing. They are still madly in love with each other and these days they live a low-key life. The two decided to have a destination wedding in Mexico the only problem was Hurricane Herman decided to show up. They were originally supposed to have the wedding on the beach but for obvious reasons they moved things indoors. It must have been a sight though to see the Hurricane gearing up. If that wasn’t bad enough though when guests started to leave an earthquake hit. Wow, you would think that having two natural disasters strike your wedding would make you think it wasn’t meant to be but these two are still going strong.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmoaGXnXqttcWeZmptXZiyrbHBq6CtsV2ssqWwyKeeZpyZqK60wMSrqmasmJbBbrnApJxmraNixLC6w56pZq%2BYrnq1tMSyZJ6ulad6qLvTZqSaqqKesqV7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
