The large estates are owned by some of the most powerful figures in culture ranging from <a href=#>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle</a> to <a href=#>Oprah Winfrey</a>. The estates range from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">humble $5 million dollar properties</a> to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$100 million estates</a> that feature their own staff and facilities. Celebrities have migrated north of Los Angeles in an attempt to escape the chaotic traffic and conditions of the city, yet still remain within driving distance for studio jobs and on-set appearances.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Ellen DeGeneres and Wife Portia de Rossi Buy $26.5 Million Montecito Mansion</a></span></p><p>The stunning properties often <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">exchange hands</a> from one celebrity to the next, passing the proverbial torch from one generations superstar to the next. For example, <a href=#>Ariana Grande</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">purchased her Montecito-based home</a> from television personality <a href=#>Ellen Degeneres and her partner Portia de Rossi</a>.&nbsp;<a href=#>Jeff Bridges</a>, too, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sold his multi-million dollar home</a> to eager buyer <a href=#>Oprah Winfrey</a>. With celebrities coming and going from the community, it makes sense that the grounds are <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fully-fenced</a> and contain exclusive streets monitored by their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">own private security</a>. Here are a list of celebrities who reside in the exclusive community, and how much they have paid to become part of one of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">most exclusive real estate club</a> on the West Coast.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=prince-harry-and-meghan-markle>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle</h2><p>It’s no surprise that when the Duke and Duchess of Sussex &nbsp;chose to&nbsp;depart from the Royal Family and move to the United States, they chose to settle next to their friend and confidante Oprah Winfrey. The couple purchased the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$14.65 million estate in 2020</a>. Their property includes nine beds and 16 baths.&nbsp;The mediterranean style home also includes a library, eat-in chef's kitchen, and several amenities including gyms, arcades, a private elevator and a master suite with a private balcony.</p><h2 id=oprah-winfrey>Oprah Winfrey</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the most successful and early adopters of the Montecito community was Oprah Winfrey. She first moved to the Santa Barbara area in&nbsp;2001 and has been residing there since. She wasn’t able to stop acquiring property in the area either. She expanded her real estate portfolio in 2016 when she purchased fellow celebrity Jeff Bridge’s Montecito&nbsp;ranch home <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in 2019</a> for a reported <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$6.85 million</a>.</p><h2 id=jeff-bridges>Jeff Bridges</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sold to Oprah Winfrey</a>, Bridges original Montecito ranch home is one of the more modest on the list with an estimated price of $6.85 million. But Bridges and his wife Susan Geston also own an additional property in Montecito, a Tuscan-style vineyard estate that sold for an additional&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$15.925 million</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ellen-degeneres-and-portia-de-rossi>Ellen Degeneres and Portia de Rossi</h2><p>Ellen Degeneres first moved into the Montecito area in 2019 when she purchased an over <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">8,000 square foot</a> estate for an estimated <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$27 million</a>. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In 2020</a>, she announced that she would be selling her Tudor-style home in the area, a decision possibly spurred by her <a href=#>recent accusations from members</a> of her staff. The decision eventually led Degeneres and De Rossi to sell the Tudor home. When they sold the property, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their buyer</a> was of equal note and is the next celebrity to appear on this list.</p><h2 id=ariana-grande>Ariana Grande</h2><p>Ariana Grande <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">purchased Ellen Degeneres Tudor-style Montecito home</a> in 2020 . She has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">posted several pictures</a> of the property as the hosting epicenter for culture including a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twilight Zone themed party</a> back in 2019.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to parties and gatherings, Grande also used the estate as the venue for her <a href=#>micro-wedding</a>. Pictures from the event showcased a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">beautiful fireplace</a> featured on the property.</p><h2 id=rob-lowe>Rob Lowe</h2><p>Rob Lowe is now recognized for his cultural longevity and relevance through appearances on the Joe Rogan Experience and his own podcast Literally. Lowe purchased <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">not one but three</a> multi-million dollar mansions in Montecito, resulting in a <a href=#>$47 million</a> transaction.&nbsp;One of the more famous properties in Lowe's growing collection is known colloquially as the "Stonehenge Estate" which cost <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$13 million</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=gwyneth-paltrow>Gwyneth Paltrow</h2><p>One of the more ambitious projects on the list is Gwyneth Paltrow and her partner Brad Falchuk’s goal to build out an already existing property within the Montecito area. The couple initially bought the property for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$5 million</a> back in 2016.&nbsp; The massive montecito mansion resides on 14,000 square feet and includes a pool and more than two acres of land.</p><p>The Montecito mansions are some of the most awe-inspiring properties on the west coast due to their proximity of the Santa Ynez mountains and the pacific coast. The properties values can climb to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$100 million</a> which keeps most of the general public out of this neck of the woods. But with neighbors like Ariana Grande, Oprah Winfrey, and a real-life Prince and Princess, the extravagant budget is a small price to pay to&nbsp;reside&nbsp;near some of the most famous and culturally significant stars in Hollywood and beyond.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>Adam Levine Purchases $22.7 Million Home In Celebrity Town, Montecito</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LoveProperty</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Observer</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MansionGlobal</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HouseandHome</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NYPost</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DailyMail</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Radar</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HookedonHouses</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LATimes</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LuxuryArchitecture</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elle</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HomesandGardens</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS6sLrTnpqirJ9iuqK60qKmp6tdmLKtscGroK2hlah6psTPnqWsoaaaeqa%2F05qrnqtf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
