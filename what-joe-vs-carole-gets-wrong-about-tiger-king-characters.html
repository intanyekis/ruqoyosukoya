The first season was a huge success, with an audience over three million. <a href=#>The second season, however, was disappointing to many fans</a>. This didn't stop the story from continuing to be told. It resulted in several spin-offs, including a podcast, on which this new show is based.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Drama Behind Joe Exotic Exposing His Cheating Husband</a></span></p><p>The podcast is still ongoing, and <a href=#>Joe Exotic is currently serving a 20-year jail sentence</a> while Carole has undergone action to sue Netflix (<a href=#>and also appeared on Dancing With The Stars</a>). But what did the fictionalized show Joe Vs. Carole, starring Kate Mckinnon and John Cameron Mitchell, get wrong about these characters?</p><h2 id=joe-exotic-s-niece-chelsei-putman-didn-t-team-up-with-carole-baskin-until-later><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Joe Exotic's Niece, Chelsei Putman, Didn't Team up with Carole Baskin Until Later</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chelsei Putman, Joe's sister's daughter</a> had issues with her uncle, as shown in the series. By November 2021, Chelsei was speaking with Carole and collaborating. In the show, Tiger King Joe Schreibvogel, did fraudulently transfer property to his mother to avoid paying creditors. Carole Baskin used this information to take Joe's zoo in June of 2021. Chelsei didn't write a letter to the Oklahoma City Judge for Carole validating this information. However, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in an interview with the Daily Mail, Chelsea admits to helping the FBI track down Joe </a>when he was in Florida on the run.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Carole Baskin Claims 'The Conservation Game' Packs More Bite Than 'The Tiger King'</a></span></p><h2 id=the-show-joe-vs-carole-left-out-joe-exotic-s-music-career><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>The Show 'Joe Vs Carole' Left Out Joe Exotic's Music Career</span></h2><p>If you loved<a href=#> the musical aspect of Tiger King and Joe's album sales</a>, you may be disappointed. In Tiger King, Joe bragged about how he has been on the cover of Hollywood Magazine twice, and released bangers like "I Saw A Tiger". There was no mention of Joe being a musician in Joe vs. Carole, even though producing 28 songs was a part of Joe's character.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-john-finlay-s-character-played-by-sam-keeley-have-enough-teeth><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Did John Finlay's Character, Played By Sam Keeley, Have Enough Teeth?</span></h2><p>In Tiger King, you may notice that Joe's Husband John has very few teeth. This is genetic, despite the rumors about drugs. In Joe vs. Carole, actor Sam Keeley has most of his teeth. Some fans pointed this out as a character flaw, but it's actually more accurate. By the time John was with Joe and the documentary was made he had fake teeth, but the Netflix producers thought having them out was more suited.</p><h2 id=the-tigers-were-hardly-tigers><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>The Tigers Were Hardly Tigers</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The CGI was so bad the tigers looked very digital. The tigers often appear in Joe vs. Carole, only they are not completely believable. The quality of the fake tigers reminds the viewer that they are watching a fictionalized version of events.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>All Six Of Howard Baskin's Film Credits - Not Just Tiger King</a></span></p><h2 id=is-kate-mckinnon-serious-enough-for-the-role-of-carole-baskin><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Is Kate McKinnon Serious Enough For The Role Of Carole Baskin?</span></h2><p>Some fans complained that Joe vs. Carole, although listed as a drama on Peacock, was too satirical. Kate McKinnon, <a href=#>who became famous for starring on Saturday Night Live</a>, brought a quirky energy to playing Carole that was a bit more youthful than the Carole Baskin we saw in the documentary</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=joe-exotic-didn-t-meet-his-first-husband-brian-rhyne-by-walking-into-a-bar-with-a-tiger><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Joe Exotic Didn't Meet His First Husband, Brian Rhyne, By Walking Into A Bar With A Tiger</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Joe-Vs-Carole.jpg><p>The two were working at the same LGBTQ+ bar in Texas together in the early 80s.

In the original series, Allen made himself out to be capable of murder and many fans felt that <a href=#>Jeff Lowe, who moved Tiger King Zoo to Mexico</a>, swindled Joe and had a deeper role in planning the hit on Carole than the show lead on. If you are looking for a deeper dive on any of the characters besides the lead roles you will not find that in this series. Joe's lead keeper, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Erik Cowie, who died last year</a>, was not even given a part.</p><h2 id=were-the-producers-correct-to-assume-anyone-even-still-cares-about-these-people><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Were The Producers Correct To Assume Anyone Even Still Cares About These People?</span></h2><p>Critics have said this is a washed-up story. But weren't we all embarrassed to admit to watching or getting into Tiger King when it became a sensation? The airing of this series is impressive after Amazon decided not to go through with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a drama about the Tiger King feud starring Nicolas Cage.</a> It appears the saga refuses to die.
