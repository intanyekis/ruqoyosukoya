Her voice is so sweet and it’s not tainted with what the world has to offer.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Kelly has also credited parenthood with making him a better person, inspiring him to give Casie a familial relationship that he didn’t have growing up.</p><p class=p1>“As much as a f–k-up people say I am, I pray that I have the connection I didn’t have with my parents with my kid. When I’m with her, nothing else matters,” Kelly previously said during a July 2015 appearance on the “Life Lessons” YouTube series. “If it was a mistake, own up. It’s not gonna be a mistake when you see that beautiful little girl pop up and you see those breaths come.”</p><p class=p1>Kelly also has three stepchildren.
