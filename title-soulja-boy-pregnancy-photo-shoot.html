Taking to Instagram at the time,&nbsp;<a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>the 31-year-old rapper</a>&nbsp;shared a video of himself and Martinez at a baby reveal party. As soon as the blue confetti and colored powder exploded, Soulja Boy started jumping up and down before running over to Martinez to give her a hug. He wrote in the caption: “It’s a boy!!”</p>AD<p>AD LOADING...</p><p>But the pregnancy stirred up some unpleasant emotions for at least one person — his “secret” girlfriend of over a decade.&nbsp;Speaking to&nbsp;Daily Mail,&nbsp;Aliyah Hayes said she met Soulja Boy when she was 19 years old and it was “love at first sight.”&nbsp;As for Martinez, Hayes thought she was simply his hairdresser and nothing more.</p><p>“I met the hairdresser maybe once or twice,” she explained. “I was really confused on their relationship. I thought she was friends with his friends. I knew she did hair. When I came across her, she was very nice to me. She knew I was his girlfriend. We would kiss and be with each other right in front of her, so I just had no idea.</p><p>“There was a Saturday I was just feeling a weird feeling that day. I was kinda sad. he was actually hosting a club I was going to attend. I decided to go to Instagram and the moment I go to Instagram, it was right there on the feed … I dropped my phone immediately. I began to feel the devastation and heartbreak of our relationship and just couldn’t understand why we never discussed this, and I’m viewing this with everyone else that follows him.”</p>AD<p>AD LOADING...</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2022/05/young-thug-gunna-rico-case.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Kevin Liles Launches Petition Against Use Of Rap Lyrics In Court: 'Weaponizing Creative Expression Is Wrong'</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>June 9, 2022</p></a><p>Hayes confessed she thought they were going to get married and start a life together. She added: “Me and him are so much closer than his fans and followers. I was devastated to find out with his seven million followers. I’m not a follower, I’m his girlfriend. I was Soulja Boy’s girlfriend for over a decade, and it’s been on and off, but it’s be on for awhile now, and she was just someone who would come over to do hair.”</p><p>But judging by the photos, Soulja Boy and the mother of his child are building a life of their own. No word on when the baby boy is due.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mignWZnaIB2hY6toK2klWPAsMHLo5hmmp%2BuerG%2BxKClmqaTrnqxtM6tpmarmKS8tQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
