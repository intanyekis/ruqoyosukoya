Fans loved their relationship, <a href=#>but it looks like something went wrong</a>. So, what happened? First, let's take a look at Madelyn's acting career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>The 24-year-old actress is a true rebel but has amassed a $500,000 net worth.</a> She was brave enough to quit college and move to Los Angeles to follow her acting ambitions against her parents' wishes. Before she was cast to play the Kook Princess, Madelyn Cline appeared on a few TV shows, including Stranger Things. Her character Tina was one of the girls who checked out Billy at the school in season two. Cline also starred in the 2018 drama Boy Erased alongside Nicole Kidman and Russell Crowe. In 2021, Madelyn shared the big screen with Naomi Watts in This Is the Night. Here is everything about Madelyn Cline's love life and complicated relationship status.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-truth-about-madelyn-cline-and-her-39-outer-banks-39-co-star-chase-stokes-39-relationship>The Truth About Madelyn Cline and Her 'Outer Banks' Co-Star Chase Stokes' Relationship</h2><p>Being on a show as two single actors must be hard, especially when they have so much chemistry. Madelyn and Chase played lovers, and viewers can tell in the scenes from season one that they really have something special even outside of acting. The pair clearly liked one another. This happens all the time on shows: Castmates get very close on-screen and then take it off-screen. For example, on Riverdale, Cole Sprouse and Lili Reinhart dated for about two years after dating on-screen during the series's first season. In Madelyn and Chase's case, it seems like they began dating around April of 2020, shortly after the filming of the first season wrapped up.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Which 'Outer Banks' Star Is The Youngest In Real Life?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They then went on to keep it secret for a few months until June of that same year when they announced it to the world. Chase shared a wonderful image of the two sitting on a beach together having a romantic dinner with the caption "cats outta the bag." They were happy together, and fans couldn't get enough of them. Viewers were all over the couple's social media pages liking photos of them and, overall, just enjoying the fact that the actors were together. Sadly, it seems like things didn't last as long between the two.</p><h2 id=why-did-chase-stokes-and-madelyn-cline-break-up>Why Did Chase Stokes and Madelyn Cline Break Up?</h2><p>Madelyn Cline came out in the early months of 2021 talking about the challenges that came up with filming the second season of Outer Banks. The actress admitted that she and Chase were very conscious not to let the relationship affect the show in any way. Madeline Klein said to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elle magazine</a>, "Prior to stepping foot on set the first day, we said, 'Hey, let's talk about this and establish boundaries before we go back, because there are so many people that it can affect.' And I hate that. I wouldn't want that at all." She added, "whenever there's any sort of personal issue, especially between the two of us, we don't bring it to work. Because it's distracting." Unfortunately, just before the filming of the third season, the couple announced that they were no longer together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Where Was The Cast Before They Landed 'Outer Banks' On Netflix?</a></span></p><h2 id=madelyn-cline-revealed-her-past-relationships-were-39-toxic-39>Madelyn Cline Revealed Her Past Relationships Were' Toxic'</h2><p>The actress found her Outer Banks experience very special and not just because of the job. Madelyn told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Flaunt</a>, "It felt like summer camp, honestly! You have this amazing casting for everyone, and then you put us in a fun location, and it just feels like the chemistry and friendship came to fruition in such a natural way."</p><p>On the other hand, Cline has a funny story of how she met her on-screen partner Chase Stokes for the first time. Chase approached her in the lobby before the audition with a strange request. He asked Madelyn to walk on his back because it badly needed to be cracked after a long flight. So when the duo was invited to read their lines together, they were already a team.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cline felt it was really important to make her on-screen relationship with Stokes look respectful and equal. It was a personal issue for Madelyn, too, as she shared in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Glamour UK</a>, "I can speak for myself, I've been through a lot of toxic relationships, and I've experienced a lot of it like gaslighting, manipulation -you name it! For young females to see what it means to respect a male is really important to me. Even if it is on a TV show, I at least want it to model that, and Chase does as well. He wanted to break those barriers for masculinity, and what masculinity looks like in a character."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the moment, fans are not sure if the actress is dating someone else. As a curious fact, when Madelyn was younger, she had a huge crush on Disney star Corbin Bleu.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:<a href=#> Real Life Ages Of The 'Outer Banks' Stars Compared To Their Characters</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqmqqRnXqkrcyeqaimXaTCtbHRZpmappuoeqO72J%2Bpop2emXqktMCsnGarpKS4pr%2BO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
