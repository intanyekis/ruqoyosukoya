Providing it's a nice hotel, of course. It gives people the chance to escape from the realities of everyday life, or at least some of them. There's a bar on hand if you need food or drink, or room service should you be so inclined, and chores are taken care of for you.</p><p>When it comes to those chores and tidying up after yourself while staying at a hotel, different people approach the subject in different ways. Some patrons will leave their room in the morning or at the end of their stay looking as if a bomb has hit it. Others will leave the hotel's housekeepers with almost nothing to do at all.</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Things Guests Do That Hotel Staff Can't Stand</a></strong></p><p>via Booking.com</p><p>There's a happy medium in there somewhere that we should all try to abide by, as revealed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lifehacker</a> by former housekeeper, Stephanie Land. First off, towels. Many people will be more than happy to leave used towels strewn about the hotel room and en suite. That's not ideal. All housekeepers ask is that you leave them all in one pile with the washcloth in the middle if you've used it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some of the "light cleaning" suggestions brought up by Land are things we really shouldn't expect from a stranger, whether they are employed to clean up after us or not. Pulling stray hair out of the drains, and flushing the toilet. We mean come on people, we are all for living a little while away from home, but does that really include leaving your business in the bowl for someone else to deal with?</p><p>There is one thing Land reveals housekeepers don't want you to do while staying at their hotel. Make the bed. Housekeepers will have a very specific way they need to make your bed, so if you make it yourself, they will then need to unmake it and remake it the correct way. Apart from that, above all else, be sure to tip the people cleaning your room, especially if you give them a lot of work to do.</p><p><strong>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Biotechnology Could Allow Prisoners To Serve A 1000-Year Sentence In 8 Hours</a></strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmraqRq7Kte8eormaooqS9pr7LsmSlnZGrsm60zq2cpWWipLyuecCcmqiqlJ67qHnEsaeeqqSofA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
