Marie and Dean Gluesenkamp share a son together.</p><p dir=ltr>Marie and Dean have been together for almost a decade. She had completed graduation in Economics from Reed College. She is a Businesswoman and media personality by profession.</p><p dir=ltr>She is a Representative from Washington’s 3rd district. She also served as an Executive Director of the Stevenson Downtown Association from March 2018 to January 2020.</p><p dir=ltr>She also became a board of supervisors in June 2019 and participated as a host of a high school-aged international exchange student via AFS-USA, AFS is a non-profit organization and CBYX for one year.</p><p dir=ltr>Despite her earnest antipathy to solid ideological stances, it has political benefits as her district confides Republicans.</p><p dir=ltr>As she represents the district, Joe Kent represents the extremes. The volunteer-supported Marie and said they could vote for a Republican but not that type of Republican, in accolade of her.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=marie-gluesenkamp-perez-family-members></span>Marie Gluesenkamp Perez Family Members<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p dir=ltr>Marie Gluesenkamp Perez is the loving child of her parents who supports her regardless of the circumstance. Marie has a sister named Elizabeth Perez.</p><p dir=ltr>Elizabeth is married and lives happily with her two kids and husband.</p><p dir=ltr>Marie’s great-grandfather Bert Gilmore helped as the quarry foreman in building Washington State Capitol Buildings while her grandmother Carol Gilmore was born in a logging camp, Sappho in Washington.</p><p dir=ltr>When she protested against abortion for the first time, many of her immediate family opposed abortion rights. She had no idea if people living in her district ever voted for her or not.</p><p dir=ltr>She said that she respected where people are coming from, and she assumes that they have good purposes. It’s much easier to have respectful conservation starting from a position of mutual respect.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=marie-gluesenkamp-perez-husband-is-from-texas></span>Marie Gluesenkamp Perez Husband Is From Texas<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Marie Perez and Dean Gluensenkamp got married in 2016. Dean always stays there as her backbone.</p><p>She talked about the mishaps when she had to go through a miscarriage in 2020 and face a challenging period.</p><p>She did not want women to be in a difficult situation where politicians like Joe Kent stands between them and critical medical care.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=dean-gluesenkamp-is-a-co-owner-of-deans-car-care-inc></span>Dean Gluesenkamp Is A Co-Owner Of Deans Car Care Inc<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Dean Gluesenkamp is an entrepreneur and a co-owner of the Deans Car Care Inc. Marie also owns the&nbsp;company&nbsp;since 2013.</p><p>The couple has encountered increasing healthcare costs for their family and pays 500 dollars each month for their toddler. As a result, they could not afford to pay for themselves.</p><p>Likewise, managing an additional sum of 1,200 dollars for healthcare is quite challenging for most Washingtonians, and the couple also needed help finding an affordable childcare home with quality. That leads them to take their infant son to the auto shop daily.</p><p>She said they had lost one out of every ten childcare facilities in the United States. Many women were on the waiting list before pregnancy whom she had already known for childcare homes.</p><p>An average family allocates more than 15,000 dollars per year to a child, which makes it challenging to save allowance for college fees, house downpayment, and paying off student loans. As she has faced the problem with her husband, she buttresses the child tax credits that assist parents in making decision right for the family.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=age-difference-between-marie-and-dean></span>Age Difference Between Marie And Dean<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Marie and Dean are almost the same age, with Dean being her senior. Marie was born on 1988 June 4, in Texas, United States, while Dean is in his 30s.</p><p>As there is a minimal age gap, their thoughts matched too. In recent decades, paramedics and medicines have been overpriced. As big pharmaceutical generates insulin for around 10 dollars per vile, however, they charge up to 30 times more for patients in desperate need.</p><p>As a result, one out of four could not afford it, which increases medical bills tremendously. She advocates for lowering healthcare, childcare, and prescription drug costs.</p><p>The couple treasures their jobs and is proud to own an auto repair shop. Which she believes is a challenging task to do in America. There is more to the eyes.</p><p>They must navigate the SBA, OSHA, the IRS, and the EPA with local permits and licenses; to deliver affordable and quality service to the clients. Recruiting and retaining the best employees is always crucial.</p><p>She believed they needed political leadership that had respect for the trades and fathomed the adversities in small business. She is buttressing micro-enterprises, startup entrepreneurs, and workers’ rights.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=marie-gluesenkamp-perez-is-a-washington-state-representative-since-2020></span>Marie Gluesenkamp Perez Is A Washington State Representative Since 2020<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p dir=ltr>Marie Gluesenkamp Perez has been Washington State Representative since 2020, and she is a 5th generation Washingtonian and the daughter of an immigrant and a pastor.</p><p dir=ltr>Marie shared a post on Instagram saying she is a bucolic Washingtonian, an auto repair shop, and a working mom. Furthermore, she will be sworn in as Southwest Washington’s independent voice in Congress.</p><p dir=ltr>She is running for the position of representative in Washington State’s Third Congressional District because she belongs to the working class group. However, she was left behind in the recession and ignored by political afflicts in the capital.</p><p dir=ltr>She sets new examples of working for her community and is regarded as the epitome of an independent voice in Congress. She is relentlessly fighting for issues facing Southwest Washingtonians and advocating democracy along with leveling the playing ground for proletarian families like hers.</p><p dir=ltr>She has been addressing Climate Change by Contributing to Clean Energy and is keen on demanding huge some from Politics by flipping Citizens United.</p><p dir=ltr>Her motto is contributing and amplifying apprenticeships and skill training programs, securing women’s access to health and rights, and undertaking the accelerating prices of food, gas, and housing.</p><p dir=ltr>She faced adversity as she did not have a foothold in House Democrats’ campaign arm, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.</p><p dir=ltr>She belongs to Democratic Party and assumed office on 3rd January 2023. Her prevailing terms expire on January 3, 2025. Marie believes that Democrats have a thinking problem regarding middle-class families as they are not part of it.</p><p dir=ltr>She beautifully replied that it feels like the affluent leadership in the Democratic party has taken it upon themselves to be heroes of the poorest amidst the poor. Which she surmises is a great thing, albeit it has been abandoned a lot in mass.</p><p dir=ltr>This gives the feeling that people do not fathom the issue faced by the middle class. She also thinks that many critical issues are unheed as they are not in the spotlight and are acclaimed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKWRp7amecalrJ6rlaO4ornPZqeeqpWveqK6w2afnqpdncK0rsCnm2aclZa7brPLrpysnZ6grq55x5qtnmWknbamvoyorqdllpa6qrjYZq6irJhivK%2BxjKSgnWc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
