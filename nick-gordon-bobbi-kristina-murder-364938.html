The Fulton County Medical Examiner reportedly stated that the autopsy shows “no obvious underlying cause of death,” and “no significant injuries were noted.” There will not be a cause of death reported until the medical examiner reviews the record.</p><p>After the loss of <a href=# id=auto-tag_whitney-houston_2 data-tag=whitney-houston>Whitney Houston</a>‘s only daughter, the microscope is now hovering over <a href=# id=auto-tag_nick-gordon_2 data-tag=nick-gordon>Nick Gordon</a>. The longtime boyfriend of the late <a href=# id=auto-tag_bobbi-kristina_2 data-tag=bobbi-kristina>Bobbi Kristina</a> Brown will soon be under investigation by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation for alleged physical and mental abuse towards her. Her best friend, Bess Beckman, <a href=# rel=nofollow>will be working with the GBI</a> to investigate the allegations.</p><p>It was reported that Gordon allegedly lost his temper and assaulted her on several occasions when Kristina informed him that she planned on going to Los Angeles to further pursue her singing and acting career. Earlier this year, she tweeted:</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Let’s start this career up&&moving OUT to TO YOU ALLLL quick shall we !?!???! !!!!!!!</p><p>— Bobbi Kristina H.G.

There will be an autopsy performed soon to determine her cause of death.</p><p>But then here comes the twist in this shady situation. Gordon is already planning his defense against his $10 Million dollar lawsuit as he hires Jose Baez, the lawyer who won infamous the Casey Anthony child abuse trial of 2011. In the lawsuit, Bobbi Kristina’s conservator Bedelia Hargrove claims that he not only physically abused her, but apparently stole over $11,000 dollars out of her bank account while she was in her medically induced coma.</p><p><strong>READ:&nbsp;<a href=#>Bobby Brown Was Acting Mighty Strange During His Fourth Of July Concert</a></strong></p><p>The Inquisitr <a href=# rel=nofollow>also reports</a> that whether or not Gordon wins or loses the civil suit, if the autopsy shows that Bobbi Kristina dies by way of brain damage from a physical assault, he will be charged with murder.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6O2pLeMoKarnJ%2BjeqO7wZugZqOinsC1tc2aZKatopmys3mSb2tya2hk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
