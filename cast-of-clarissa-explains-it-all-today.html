While he did offer parental advice from time to time, he was not the go-to parent for the kids. O'Connor admitted he had more reservations about a neighbor boy climbing into Clarissa's window than his character apparently did.&nbsp;</p><p>After his 65 episodes playing Marshall Darling, he once again teamed up with Hart when he appeared on one&nbsp;episode of "Sabrina the Teenage Witch."&nbsp;He has been super busy guest starring on various TV shows since the mid-'90s, including a couple of episodes of "The Practice" and "The West Wing." In the early 2000s, he had a six-episode arc as&nbsp;Tom Vogel on "Mad Men." He has also rounded out his career with&nbsp;several TV&nbsp;movies, short films, and features.</p><p>O'Connor's personal life must be very personal indeed. He does not have a large internet presence, and most biography sites only list his acting credits and have very little information to share about him beyond this.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEpaCsrF6YvK57kG1obW9hZXykrdKtZKieXZi5or7IrKqaZZWtva2tyKeqZqGkYq6tuIytpp2ZqWQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
