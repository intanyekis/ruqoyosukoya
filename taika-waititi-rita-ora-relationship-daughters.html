In August 2021, the two made their red carpet debut at The Suicide Squad premiere.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since then, the two haven't been hiding their relationship, and they were spotted together at industry events like the Met Gala and the MTV Europe Music Awards.</p><p>In June 2022, <a href=#>engagement rumors broke</a>, but neither Rita Ora nor Taika Waititi confirmed them. In August 2022 the two were photographed with matching gold wedding bands, and many immediately believed that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the two secretly tied the knot</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Rita Ora Opens Up About Her Romance With ‘Thor’ Director Taika Waititi For The First Time In ‘Vogue Australia’">Rita Ora Opens Up About Her Romance With ‘Thor’ Director Taika Waititi For The First Time In ‘Vogue Australia’</a></span></p><p>"It was a really intimate ceremony and super special for everyone there. Their nearest and dearest can see how madly in love they are," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a source told The Sun</a>. "Despite living in the spotlight, Rita is determined to keep the relationship as private as possible and didn't want to make a big song and dance about the wedding."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On Jaime Winstone's podcast, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rita Ora opened up about her relationship</a>. "I'm in love. I'm very much in love. I'm in love, I'm in love, amen! But I love love as well. I've always been such a believer in it and I've always felt like I always wanted the fairytale and that's what I grew up loving," the singer said.</p><p>"My parents have been together for over 30 years, so for me it was always about love and finding a partner and all that, so I'm really happy I did," Rita Ora added. "I made that choice. It made me happy and I love Taika. He's so funny and lovely."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-rita-ora-meet-taika-waititi-39-s-daughters>Did Rita Ora Meet Taika Waititi's Daughters?</h2><p>Before starting a relationship with Rita Ora, the New Zealand filmmaker was married to film producer Chelsea Winstanley — the two tied the knot in 2011 but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">quietly split in 2018</a>.</p><p>Waititi and Winstanley have two daughters — Te Hinekāhu, ten, and Matewa Kiritapu, six. Anyone who keeps up with Taika Waititi (especially his Instagram series Dads on Tour) knows just how close the filmmaker is with them.</p><p>In fact, Taika Waititi has taken his daughters to red carpet premieres numerous times — and he even gave them the role of Asgardian children in Thor: Love And Thunder, the movie that he directed. In an interview with People, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Waititi even revealed that the monsters in the movie are inspired by his children's drawings</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"The monsters in the film were originally based on drawings that all of our kids did," Waititi said. "I was typing the script and my daughter kind of leaned over and she was like, 'What's an oil monster?' That's like the first thing I could come up with [when] I was writing. I said, 'I have no idea. I just wrote oil monster, whatever that means.' And she goes, 'What do you think that looks like? Do you think it's spiky?' And then she draws this like snakey thing."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Taika Waititi And Rita Ora's Cringey Met Gala Moments Just Went Viral">Taika Waititi And Rita Ora's Cringey Met Gala Moments Just Went Viral</a></span></p><p>While Rita Ora hasn't publicly spoken about Taika Waititi's children, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she has been spotted with them in Paris</a> where she even held the younger one's hand. Of course, since the couple is married it isn't surprising that Te Hinekāhu and Matewa Kiritapu have met the English singer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Judging from the fact that the couple seems to be very happy, there is no doubt that Waititi's daughters have accepted the musician as part of their family. After all, the two wouldn't walk around Paris hand in hand with the star if they weren't accepting of her.</p><p>In an interview with the Independent, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rita Ora revealed that she froze her eggs</a> in hopes of having children of her own one day.</p><p>"I'd love to have a nice big family, and I think as women, we put that pressure on ourselves, subconsciously, because we feel like that is our duty – to create and give life," the singer said. "So, I just wanted to not worry about it. And I didn’t after, and it was the best thing I ever did."</p><p>Only time will tell whether the singer and the filmmaker will end up having children of their own, but for now they seem very happy with their little family — Waititi's daughters included.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmqGblnq4rcitoK2hXae2ta2MqKmaZaKauaLAyKilrKCZpXqlrdSgn62doqh8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
