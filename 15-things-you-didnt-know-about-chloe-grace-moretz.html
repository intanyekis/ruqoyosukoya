When it comes to teen leading ladies, the 20-year-old is kind of a big deal. From her reported relationship with <a href=#>David Beckham</a>'s son, Brooklyn, to her Twitter feud with socialite <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a>, she's a young actress with a lot of talent to back it all up! She began her acting career in 2004 at the age of seven and received her first award nomination the following year for a supernatural film called The Amityville Horror. Her other early film credits include&nbsp;The Poker House, (500) Days of Summer, Diary of a Wimpy Kid, and Let Me In. She has also dipped in modeling, partaking in cover and feature photoshoots for Vogue, Marie Claire, Elle&nbsp;and Coach.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Moretz may not be the first name you think of when it comes to teen actress, but she's definitely on her way to the top. You've probably seen her in a handful of movies and can't help but get the feeling that she's just getting started. She was born in Atlanta, Georgia and raised in Cartersville, Georgia to a nurse practitioner mother and a plastic surgeon father. She has four older brothers and has described her family as "very Christian." She became interested in acting after moving to New York City in 2002 following a brother's acceptance into the Professional Performing Arts School in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan.</p><p>There's so much to know about this talented young woman, so let's take a look at 15 things that you probably didn't know about Moretz.</p><h2 id=she-s-not-afraid-to-speak-her-mind><strong>She's Not Afraid To Speak Her Mind</strong></h2><p>Looking for further proof that Moretz is all grown up? When Kim Kardashian posted a nude selfie scandal on Twitter with the caption, "When you're like I have nothing to wear LOL," Moretz took a hard-line stance against people who bare it for all the internet to see. Even though she found herself in the middle of a sl*t-shaming Twitter storm, she respectfully stood her ground. Kardashian fired back, tweeting, "Let's all welcome @ChloeGMoretz to twitter, since no one knows who she is. your nylon cover is cute boo."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Moretz denied sl*t-shaming Kardashian, and she said that the people who have criticized her are missing the bigger picture. The feud caused a number of other celebrities to take sides, including several who tweeted their own naked pictures in support of Kardashian and a woman's right to do what she wants with her own body. In response to the backlash, she tweeted, "There's a huge difference in respecting the platform that you're given as a celebrity and 'sl*t shaming' something I never have done and would never do."</p><h2 id=she-uses-her-influence-for-good><strong>She Uses Her Influence For Good</strong></h2><p>Moretz is an influential young star who has opened up about the discrimination aimed at two of her brothers, Trevor and Colin, based on their s*xual orientation.</p><p>In an interview with Nylon magazine, Moretz said, "At 11, you're incredibly observant and realizing what society is, and who you are, and people are kissing boys or girls for the first time, and you're really starting to understand what s*xuality is." Moretz revealed of how her brother's experiences affected her, before adding, "The problem is we live in a society where we have to say the words, 'I'm coming out.' No one should care what your s*xual orientation is, what color your skin is, or if you're a man or a woman."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"People would call them the F-word, and I would get so angry," Moretz added. "It was really hard to see my brothers be hated on or bullied, so I stood up for them. We shouldn't be using these terms to create more labels and segregate us further apart than we already are. At a young age, I was motivated to fight for gay rights, women's rights, minority rights — all human rights."</p><h2 id=she-wasn-t-always-the-only-sister><strong>She Wasn't Always The Only Sister</strong></h2><p>There comes a time in every young star's life when he or she must break out of whatever sweet ideal has been constructed around them. When that happens, you can choose from a menu of options like the nearly nude photoshoot, the bad-boy boyfriend, the s*x tape, the unexpected role, or the dramatic makeover. Moretz was the smart, fashion-loving girl who chose the latter. She stepped out with a new nose ring in New York in June of 2015. And just before that, Hollywood's favorite tattoo artist, Dr. Woo, shared a photo of Moretz's first tattoo.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2011, Moretz told Interview magazine, "I used to have a sister, but I never got to meet her, because she died after two days, I think. So if I got a tattoo, it would probably be something to do with my sister." Sure enough, the letters TBTKCE are the initials of everyone in her family, including siblings Brandon, Trevor, Colin, and Ethan, and mother Teri. K must refer to said sister. Her father, McCoy Lee Moretz, didn't make the cut.</p><h2 id=she-still-got-grounded><strong>She Still Got Grounded</strong></h2><p>On the big screen, Moretz is about to break out as a bad-a*s assassin in Kick Ass: The Game. In real life, her bedtime is 9:30 p.m., and she has to refer to the movie as "Kick-Butt" around her parents. She has stopped by the MTV studios to discuss her inclusion in their "10 to Watch in 2010" series, as well as where Hollywood ends and middle school begins.</p><p>Starring in blockbuster hits may give you a leg up in Hollywood, but it won't get you any special treatment in the Moretz family. Chloë assured the masses of normalcy, saying, "My mom has always said that if I get a big head, she'll take me out of this business as quickly as I got into it." Referring to herself as an "average, everyday girl," Chloë added, "I have to go to bed at 9:30, and if I'm up late on the computer, I lose it for two months." Yikes!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-trained-with-jackie-chan-s-stunt-team><strong>She Trained With Jackie Chan's Stunt Team</strong></h2><p>And while we're on the subject of Kick-Ass, Moretz trained with <a href=#>Jackie Chan</a>'s stunt team when she was just 12 years old in preparation for the Hit-Girl role. It was a violent film, and she received a lot of criticism for being so young and having to say some crude lines. However, she reaped many rewards from making her own decisions.</p><p>When Moretz prepped for the contentious role, she did most of her own stunts while filming. She put a great amount of effort in her role and deserves to be applauded for that. She reportedly brought up that her character, Cassie, wasn't just a copy of Katniss Everden, saying, "Cassie is her own independent, modern-day woman...She's just ordinary, not some overtrained, highly specialized girl...It's a story of perseverance and survival, and she goes from an ordinary girl to one of the most courageous women you’ll ever see on screen, especially at that age."</p><h2 id=she-was-known-as-the-busiest-actress-in-hollywood-at-age-13><strong>She Was Known As "The Busiest Actress In Hollywood" At Age 13</strong></h2><p>Moretz was still a teenager at the time, but she has established herself as someone unafraid of what others think. Yes, Kick-Ass got its own sequel, Kick-Ass 2, and she reappeared as the Hit-Girl. Her career totally kicked off as she was in the process of filming so many movies we can't even keep up. However, she still finds time to attend fashion events, like the Dior Illustrated event, looking unbelievably glam for a 13-year-old.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Moretz's offbeat filmography also includes rom-coms, vampire flicks, and murder mysteries. She told British magazine Grazia that she admired, "<a href=#>Natalie Portman</a> – you can tell she's a genuinely nice person; she's not fake. She's so beautiful and an amazing actress… I also love <a href=#>Audrey Hepburn</a>, <a href=#>Cate Blanchett</a>, <a href=#>Kirsten Dunst</a>. They've all made phenomenal choices and chosen love of good film over money – I think that's the way to go." Great response, girl! Keep up the good work!</p><h2 id=she-s-a-feminist><strong>She's A Feminist</strong></h2><p>At 19 years old, Moretz already learned a lot about what it means to be a role model in Hollywood. She said it all went back to her first leading role in the 2013 remake of Carrie. She told Business Insider, "I really realized, oh, there's a lot of stuff going on here for women that I need to clue in on and understand it," while doing press for the movie Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the set of Carrie, Moretz said that she felt she had to speak up for the first time in her career, especially because she was in a movie about a girl having her period for the first time while she was also being controlled by male studio heads. She said she learned from the experience that it was okay to fight for something you believe in. She added, "Don't just be argumentative, don't be loud for no reason, but don't apologize for fighting." This was something she talked over with her biggest mentor in showbiz, <a href=#>Julianne Moore</a>, who played Moretz' mother in Carrie.</p><h2 id=she-s-a-hillary-clinton-supporter><strong>She's A Hillary Clinton Supporter</strong></h2><p>On the topic of feminism, Moretz has always portrayed strong female characters. After her hiatus, she read the script for The Miseducation of Cameron Post, in which she stars as a young girl forced into a gay conversion therapy center. She shot the movie during the election, and the outcome left her stunned. She went to bed early on election night because she had to be up at dawn for her call time. When she woke up, she looked at her phone and screamed, "Oh, my gosh. I'm going to work on a gay conversion therapy movie, which (Mike) <a href=#>Pence</a> supports!" She sobbed until director Desiree Akhavan addressed the cast and crew.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Moretz is 100 percent sure that she'll see a female president in her lifetime, whether it's <a href=#>Hillary Clinton</a> or not. She's concerned about the actions of the <a href=#>Donald Trump</a> administration. Most of her friends wanted to flee the United States following Trump's victory, but she told them, "No! That's not what you do as an American. As an American, you fight for your country, and we protect our country, and we protect our rights, and we protect those that are weak and cannot speak."</p><h2 id=she-s-a-big-hockey-fan><strong>She's A Big Hockey Fan</strong></h2><p>Moretz is a young lady from Georgia, but she's a huge hockey fan. She apparently has two NHL teams—the Los Angeles Kings and the New York Islanders. You may not agree with someone being a fan of two or more teams, but she can follow whoever she wants. This January, she let her natural beauty shine at the NHL All-Star Game in Los Angeles. She attended the game with her brother, Colin, and enjoyed <a href=#>Nick Jonas</a>' performance during the half-time show. She's also an Islanders fan. She was all decked out in her Islanders gear, and apparently, her presence is a good luck charm for the other New York team.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even if you don't care about the Islanders and Kings, you have to admit that Moretz looks good in either jersey. Her lovely blonde locks and red berry lips complete her outfits on the ice. She has also met some of the players. It wouldn't be a surprise if she ended up with one of them because she's a gorgeous gal who has tons of hockey intellect.</p><h2 id=she-keeps-her-work-life-separate-from-her-personal-life><strong>She Keeps Her Work Life Separate From Her Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Moretz may have the upper hand in her circle of friends, but that doesn't automatically mean that they're together 24 hours a day, seven days a week. In fact, she doesn't invite her friends to the sets or movie premieres because she prefers to keep her work life separate from her personal life. And there's nothing wrong with that.</p><p>Some people have co-workers with whom they only communicate with in the workplace. Others hang out with co-workers outside of the workplace. It all depends on the feelings and circumstances. There are instances where co-workers do become your friends in real life and vice versa. Also, keep in mind that bringing your real-life friends to work doesn't equal fun because they won't always be entertained—especially if you're in the middle of an assignment, and they can get bored after sitting around for a while—unless if they're always up for a good conversation with a stranger.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-s-close-with-her-family><strong>She's Close With Her Family</strong></h2><p>Moretz is just as much of a tomboy as she is a princess. After all, she has four older brothers—Brandon, Trevor, Colin, and Ethan. She first got into acting because of Trevor. They'd run over lines together, and she loved it so much that her family decided to take her to some auditions. He eventually became her acting coach, accompanying her whenever she travels, just like any big-hearted brother would.</p><p>Moretz said, "My mom has always taught us that blood is thicker than water...No one will ever understand the dynamic of your family. Ever. We are the closest family ever, and we are the most insane family ever. It may look weird to others, but to us, it's life." Her family probably isn't perfect, but it seems like they're happy with each other's company, and they wouldn't have it any other way. They certainly fit into the description of family goals.</p><h2 id=she-named-her-dogs-after-her-first-major-film><strong>She Named Her Dogs After Her First Major Film</strong></h2><p>The Amityville Horror left a lasting mark on the young actress. Moretz was only six years old when she landed the role of Chelsea Lutz, a daughter from Kathy Lutz' previous marriage. Kathy's new husband is George Lutz, and the family moved into a home on Long Island in the town of Amityville. The family began experiencing paranormal events in the home. George's behavior towards his wife and three children becomes abusive. As the paranormal activity continued, Kathy became convinced that George's behavior was owed by a spiritual possession, which led her to evacuate her family from the home. But he ended up attempting to kill his family. Fortunately, she was able to knock him out and transport him away from the home, which eventually rearranged itself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In its honor, Moretz named her male dog Fuller after its producer Bradley Fuller, and she named her female dog Missy after Chelsea's nickname in the film.</p><h2 id=she-s-generous><strong>She's Generous</strong></h2><p>Despite the fame and fortune, Moretz remains simple and humble. She works with Children of the Night, a privately-funded nonprofit organization that is dedicated to getting girls off the street in the United States. It was established in 1979 to rescue American children from the ravages of prostitution.</p><p>So, whenever Moretz gets free clothes, one of the perks of being an actress, she brings them to the shelter. She told The Independent, "If you're giving them to an actor who can buy their own clothes, go give them to a shelter! So every time I get boxes, I don't even open the boxes...I just take them straight to the shelter and go, 'Here you go, here's your stuff, because this is not what I need. I just do my job. I don't deserve that.'" People who bring something to the table are wonderful, and she's setting a tremendous example for today's youth by donating to shelters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-was-homeschooled-by-her-mother><strong>She Was Homeschooled By Her Mother</strong></h2><p>Moretz starred in Kick-Ass and Kick-Ass 2.&nbsp;But at home, she was just a normal student being homeschooled. She described the experience, saying, "It's not bad at all." Her mother served as her teacher, but they were both accommodating of their schedules. She said, "She understands that I like to sleep in because I get all these hours when I'm working...I get like 6 a.m. starts, so we start school around 9:30. We work will 6 p.m. but it's worth it."</p><p>In an interview with Time magazine, Moretz talked about taking time off from showbiz and going to college. She said, "I think I'm going to take two years off to see what it's like and then go to school for film editing and cinematography." We're sure that whatever she decides to do in life, she'll do a great job because she's a fantastic person on and off the silver screen.</p><h2 id=her-address-is-in-la-but-her-heart-is-in-nyc><strong>Her Address Is In LA, But Her Heart Is In NYC</strong></h2><p>Moretz lives in the Studio City neighborhood of Los Angeles, but she has admitted that she's a New Yorker at heart. During an interview for Teen Vogue, she told a writer, "Los Angeles is fun and I've lived there for 10 years, but there's something about New York. I'm pretty much New York in every way." She also confessed that she turns into a total tourist when she steps onto an observation deck overlooking the famed Central Park in Manhattan.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There are pros and cons about living in Los Angeles and New York City, so it's perfectly normal to have feelings for both the west and east coasts. Moretz will always have a special place in her heart for the Big Apple. She has cheered on the New York Islanders, trolled the Washington Capitals, and became the new face of Coach. She wants to become one of America's sweethearts, and her love affair with NYC certainly makes her an all-American girl.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWZqbV2ptaq6xqxksqelYrGqsM2tZKSmn6x6oq7Orqtmm5ihvKZ5xquYnJ1doryzsdOzZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
