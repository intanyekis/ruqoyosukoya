Shane, 31, uploaded a one-hour video called ‚ÄúThe Return of Eugenia Clooney‚Äù after last updating <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>his channel</a> in Feb. 2019, and it has already surpassed 1.5 million views and moved Twitter on July 19. The emotional documentary began by recapping the speculation and cruel weight comments from YouTube viewers who accused Eugenia of having an eating disorder (there were many, as she boasts 1.6 million subscribers). The 24-year-old YouTuber had repeatedly denied the rumors before her honest conversation with Shane.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>‚ÄúI was in a rehab kind of program for it and [it] was really kind of a weird experience I guess,‚Äù Eugenia confessed to Shane, who visited her home sometime after she announced her break from YouTube in Feb. 2019. While seeking treatment at the facility, Eugenia admitted she was ‚Äúhonestly kind of surprised‚Äù after finding out how ‚Äúlow‚Äù her weight was compared to before, a realization that was ‚Äúshocking‚Äù to her. Eugenia even revealed that doctors were ‚Äúsurprised‚Äù that she was ‚Äúlucky‚Äù and didn‚Äôt experience a critical number of negative side effects from her low weight.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Eugenia had stayed hush about her health up until this vulnerable documentary, and so there was an immediate outpouring of supportive tweets. ‚ÄúOkay everyone let‚Äôs say it together, THANK YOU SHANE DAWSON FOR HELPING US FORM A NEW LOVE FOR THE AMAZING EUGENIA COONEY,‚Äù one fan <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tweeted</a>, while an especially touched viewer posted, ‚Äú<span class=PrettyLink-prefix>@</span><span class=PrettyLink-value>Eugenia_Cooney</span> seeing how you respond to ppl even through all that tough shit (like the video call, just wow) is really inspiring and incredibly refreshing to see.The <span class=PrettyLink-prefix>@</span><span class=PrettyLink-value>shanedawson</span> video almost had me in tears seeing how happy you looked to be able to share your recovery story.‚Äù</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Seeing so much support is making me cry. üò≠ Thank you guys so so much for being so kind and positive towards me.
