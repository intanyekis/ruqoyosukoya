In truth, she has a fierce work ethic behind the scenes and fans knows she's quite the perfectionist. Heck, Tyra Banks revealed that just for an interview, <a href=#>Beyoncé would rehearse for two hours prior</a>. Her hard work clearly paid off, literally, as the star was able to pocket as much as <a href=#>$24 million for a single performance</a>.</p><p>In the following, we're going to put the spotlight on another performance. This one wasn't as pricey, but a lot more important. Beyoncé had the importance task of singing during Barack Obama's inauguration. However, problems would emerge behind the scenes as the artist wasn't given enough time to rehearse with the Marine band. Because of this, Beyoncé decided to lip sync during her performance. We'll reveal how that was received, and what took place behind the scenes during the nervous moments just prior.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Meeting Beyonce Almost Turned Into A Nightmare For Adele, And We Completely Understand Why</a></span></p><h2 id=beyonc-eacute-39-s-performance-at-barack-obama-39-s-inauguration-was-pre-recorded-during-the-final-stages-due-to-a-lack-of-rehearsal-time>Beyoncé's Performance At Barack Obama's Inauguration Was Pre-Recorded During The Final Stages Due To A Lack Of Rehearsal Time</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/th-image-template-1-2.jpg><p>The Marine Corp band revealed that Beyoncé's decision not to sing was made during the final minutes prior to her performance. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The band issued a statement with THR at the time</a>, “All music [for inaugural ceremonies] is prerecorded as a matter of course, and that’s something we’ve done for years and years. The Marine Band did perform live throughout the ceremony, but we received last-minute word that Beyoncé wanted to use the recording.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Marine Corps would issue another statement later, claiming that given they were added to the performance, it didn't give Beyoncé enough time to rehearse with them. Due to the importance of the stage, it wasn't the time to take a risk.</p><p>The statement reads, “The Presidential Inaugural Committee (PIC) requested that the Marine Band accompany Beyoncé Knowles-Carter in the performance of the Star-Spangled Banner at the 2013 Inaugural Ceremony. However, there was no opportunity for Ms. Knowles-Carter to rehearse with the Marine Band before the Inauguration so it was determined that a live performance by the band was ill-advised for such a high-profile event."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Beyoncé's Alleged 'Worst Song' Got Mixed Reactions From Her Fanbase</a></span></p><p>Credit to Beyoncé who also took it upon herself to reveal what really went on and in truth, it is hard to question Beyoncé's decision.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=beyonc-eacute-was-proud-of-her-decision-give-that-it-was-such-an-important-moment>Beyoncé Was Proud Of Her Decision Give That It Was Such An Important Moment</h2><p>Beyoncé is a true perfectionist and when it comes to her performances, there are hours upon hours of rehearsals behind the scenes. This wasn't the case during her inauguration appearance, which might've been the biggest performance of her career. Given the importance of the moment, it wasn't time to take any kind of risks.</p><p>That being said, Beyoncé decided to record the song herself just prior, and would sing along during the performance. She even removed her earpiece to match the lyrics properly.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyoncé talked about the emotional day</a>, and her reasoning for the pre-recorded track.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She tells CBS News, "I practice until my feet bleed and I did not have time to rehearse with the orchestra," she said. "Due to no proper sound check, I did not feel comfortable taking a risk. It was about the president and the inauguration, and I wanted to make him and my country proud, so I decided to sing along with my pre-recorded track, which is very common in the music industry. And I'm very proud of my performance."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>Beyonce And Jay-Z Had Strict Rules For Kim And Kanye's Wedding, But Ultimately They Didn't Even Show Up</a></span></p><p>Beyoncé did receive heat at the time given that Marine band was playing live, while she opted out instead. Nonetheless, her reasoning for not taking the risk makes complete sense. And for what it's worth, the artist appeared at the Super Bowl shortly after for the halftime show. Though this time, there was no lip-syncing involved, and Beyoncé and her finest.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=barack-obama-had-major-praise-for-beyonc-eacute-in-the-past-claiming-quot-she-runs-the-world-quot>Barack Obama Had Major Praise For Beyoncé In The Past Claiming, "She Runs The World"</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/president-barack-obama-sasha-obama-and-malia-obama.jpg><p>Looking back, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Obama had had lots of praise for Beyoncé</a> and her impact on the world. Obama called Beyoncé the best role model for his daughters, which is truly the ultimate compliment. In addition, the former President of the United States praised Beyoncé's standing in the world, calling her a true pioneer.</p><p>Obama said, “A lot of folks didn’t even think blacks had the tools to be a quarterback,” Obama told students during a speech. “When I was a graduate, the main black hero on TV was Mr T. Rap and hip-hop were counter-culture. Now Shonda Rhimes owns Thursday night and Beyoncé runs the world.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Clearly, there is mutual respect from both sides. As expected, Obama didn't make any type of statement regarding Beyoncé's performance and in truth, we assume the former President fully understood Beyoncé's decision to lip-sync during the important moment in history.</p><p>SOURCES - THR & CBS News</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdl7K6u82cnGavkah6rbXPZqqyppOeu6h5w66poqaXYq%2BivsCcomankpa6or%2BMoqWarZeqv6LAyKilaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
