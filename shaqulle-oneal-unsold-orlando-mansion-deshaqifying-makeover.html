He has made a fortune, and that has enabled him to live like an absolute king. In fact, he may have <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">lived so largely </a>that<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> the house he has had up for sale since 2018 </a>is way out of most people's league. He's been trying to sell his mansion for 3 years now, and has turned to a shift in advertising and a new realtor in order to make it happen. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">House Beautiful </a>reports that after sitting for so long on the market without generating a serious buyer, the mansion has now undergone some changes, in an effort to entice a sale. Most would assume that owning Shaquille O'Neal's former home would be a huge draw, but the new approach to selling his massive $16.5 million home is to remove the majority of references to his image.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dwayne Johnson Buys Paul Reiser's $28 Million Beverly Park Mansion</a></span></p><p>Shaquille O'Neal lived in a stunning 31,000 square foot mansion. That's not a typo. This immense home is as large as the life that Shaquille has led, and it boasts features and amenities like no other.</p><p>Each room within this enormous property is incredibly spacious, with ultra high ceilings and open concept spaces.

For starters, he took down a life size Superman statue that appeared at the front of the home. He also removed the "S" monogram that was predominantly featured throughout various parts of the home.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The mansion has been completely redesigned, and stripped of the elements that were indicative of Shaquille's unique, personal style choices.</p><p>What remains, is a subdued version of what once was the 'loudly decorated' home of a basketball legend.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lima Ohio</a> reports that this property is; "walled off from the street and behind a gate inside the gated Isleworth Golf and Country Club, the 12-bedroom, 11-bathroom manor sits on 3.9 acres, including 700 feet of waterfront."</p><p>Some of the features within this home will absolutely stun potential buyers. For starters, there is a 6,000 square foot indoor basketball court. There is also a showroom style garage that can easily store well over 17 vehicles in showroom style, by putting them on display and allowing for ample viewing space between each luxurious automobile.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The home office overlooks the waterfront with a full view of Lake Butler, and the kitchen is a massive, open concept area that can easily be used for entertaining.</p><p>Aside from the obviously<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> impressive features that this mansion includes</a>, were some other features that aren't as widely possible and may have hindered the sale of this sprawling estate.</p><p>Now looking sharp, modern and toned down from the blatant references to Shaquille O'Neal's ownership, the mansion has hit the market for $16.5 million, with high hopes for a quick sale.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lil Wayne Buys Massive $15 Million Hidden Hills Mansion</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">House Beautiful,</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lima Ohio,</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Dallas News</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTAqa3QrqOlnV2ku6aty2asp6ufobFuu9GlmKecn2K6orrSoqanZZSawKmt0KKdsqGenHqurcqepq%2BdomQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
