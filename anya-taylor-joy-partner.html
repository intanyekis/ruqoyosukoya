Yes, they're husband and wife. A source confirmed that the couple secretly hosted their wedding in 2022. However, the couple has yet to talk about their marriage.</strong></p><p><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Anya-Josephine Marie Taylor-Joy</strong></a> (b.

She was named to Time magazine's 100 Next list in 2021.</p><p>Anya Taylor-Joy, who was born in Miami and raised in Buenos Aires and London, dropped out of school at 16 to pursue a career as an actor. Following small television roles, she made her feature film debut in The Witch, followed by Split, Glass, and the black comedy Thoroughbreds.

Moreover, she has since appeared in the films The Northman and The Menu, both released in 2022.</p><p>Fans are naturally curious about the actor's <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>personal life</strong></a> and relationship with her rumored spouse <strong>Malcolm McRae</strong> as a result of her sudden rise to fame. Rumors of their romance began when the couple was spotted getting cozy out and about in New York City just days before Taylor-scheduled Joy's hosting debut on Saturday Night Live in May 2021. Many people are wondering if they are married after she was seen wearing a ring on her hand in June 2022. Since her fans are eager to learn more about her partner, let's get started.</p><p>Previously, we touched on the&nbsp;<strong><a href=# rel=noopener>relationship status</a></strong> of <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Sara Jane Ho</strong></a> and <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Anne Burrell</strong></a>.</p><h2>Anya Taylor-Joy’s Partner/Husband in 2022: The Queen’s Gambit Star Secretly Married to Malcolm McRae!</h2><p><strong>Anya Taylor-Joy</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@anyataylorjoy</a>) first admitted to being in a relationship with partner <strong>Malcolm McRae</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@malcolmmcrae</a>) in April 2021. McRae has been referred to as her hobby. She is also featured in one of McRae's songs. They encourage each other's careers and are not afraid to post about each other on social media. McRae was born on April 16, 1994, and Anya was also born on the same day. She posted a couple of sweet photos with McRae in the woods and on a carriage ride on Instagram in 2022 to commemorate their joint birthday.</p><p>Anya's partner, McRae was <a href=# rel=noopener>discovered</a> among 1,100 hopeful performers at the Actors, Models & Talent for Christ where he won Over All Young Actor in 2006 at 12. However, music is the true subject of McRae's work. He sings rock, pop, folk, rockabilly, and musical theater, and he also plays guitar and the piano. McRae posted a video of himself performing Settled In for his Instagram followers in April. Moreover, he is a member of a band named, More. Malcolm met former Portugal The Man member <strong>Kane Ritchotte</strong> and signed a deal with Warner Records.</p><p>Furthermore, they've been making music for over three years and have even received validation from Spotify. Last summer, More released the first half of her two-part EP, 1/2. The young actress claimed to be a paralegal in Pasadena, California, where he even claimed to have written the lyrics to the song Elaborate Attractions while on the job. The musician, who is now Anya Taylor's partner revealed that he wrote the song, Really Want to See You Again, only two days before meeting Taylor Joy on March 11, 2022.</p><p>People began to wonder if Anya Taylor-Joy and her partner got <a href=# rel=noopener>married</a> after she was seen wearing a ring on her hand in June 2022. A month later, it was revealed that they had already married. The couple announced their engagement just a few weeks after the singer and actor was spotted with The Queen's Gambit actress in Sydney wearing her green diamond engagement ring. They went a step further and secretly married in July 2022 in a small courtroom ceremony.</p><p>Yes, they're husband and wife now. The two were reported to be practically living together. The prequel/spin-off to Mad Max: Fury Road, Furiosa is currently in production. Before leaving for Australia to finish filming, the actress married her partner. Meanwhile, neither McRae nor Anya had commented on the wedding reports.</p><p>The Menu actress <a href=# rel=noopener>purchased</a> a flat in east London last year, and while she's been away working for a long time, she loves nothing more than to spend time with musician Malcolm McRae, even if it's just doing chores and other mundane tasks. Since they began dating sometime last year, the couple has kept their relationship private, only appearing in public on occasion. The two were seen holding hands and kissing while walking around New York. Taylor-Joy and McRae proved their relationship was still going strong after Labor Day when paparazzi caught them kissing in Venice.</p><p>Moreover, they posed together at the Vanity Fair Oscars after-party. They didn't hide their feelings for each other during the screening of her film The Northman on April 5 in London. Taylor-Joy and her partner kissed in front of photographers in one of their most public displays of affection to date. Moreover, McRae has also shared two photos of himself and the Netflix star standing in a window's reflection, smiling and holding hands, on October 20, 2021. Anya and Malcolm walked through the streets of Los Angeles during a heat wave.</p><p>Similarly, the couple held hands as they walked and were photographed embracing and kissing here and there on their date night in West Hollywood. On October 18, the couple dined at Mark And Vinny's spaghetti in Sydney. They couldn't keep their hands off each other as they waited for their food, leaning in to steal kisses and hugs. McRae even kissed Taylor-hand Joy in a romantic gesture at one point. Additionally, the couple is both very supportive of each other's professional endeavors and even share the same birthdays. However, the couple has never acknowledged their relationship publicly.</p><p><strong>Visit&nbsp;<a href=#>House & Whips</a>&nbsp;for more&nbsp;<a href=#>interesting stories</a>&nbsp;about your favorite celebs.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6rApq3Nna6hoaCoe6S7zGiYp7GRYsGixcuoqWain656sa3RraWeql8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
