I am a straight (forward) guy, I work hard for myself to get to where I want to get,” he said.</p><p>Zaheer in a contract signed between himself and the Dubai based company “would assist ZLIVIA with all documentation, including payment of any taxes, customs and levies relating to the purchase of the commodity”.</p><p>“The company contracted me for my consultancy services which was purely based on advisory on taxation and exportation of the gold that was to come from the Democratic Republic of Congo,” Zaheer said.</p><p>He further clarified that the gold that is allegedly detained at a Kenyan airport is still in DR Congo.</p><p>“We are waiting for the gold to come from Congo so that we can be able to export it to Dubai,” he explained.</p><p>His role would see him pocket a whooping Sh1.43 billion.</p><p>Known for his larger than life lifestyle, the flashy politician also hangs around the likes of President Uhuru Kenyatta, DP William Ruto and Governor Mike Sonko.</p><p>His remarks came hours after a phone conversation between a man believed to be Senator Moses Wetangula and a foreigner was leaked online.</p><p>The legislator is said to have been part of a group that swindled the Dubai nationals.</p><p>“Raila met with head of State on this matter (controversial gold) and explained to him and the head of state has called the minister (Matiang’i),” the man believed to be Wetangula said.</p><p><strong>Email your news TIPS to&nbsp;<a href=#>Editor@kahawatungu.com</a>&nbsp;or WhatsApp +254707482874.
