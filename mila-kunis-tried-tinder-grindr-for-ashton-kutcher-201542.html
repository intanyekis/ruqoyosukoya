Tinder came up, naturally, while the two were chatting about Kutcher's tech investments.&nbsp;</p><p>"People run these things by him all the time. Listen — when we started dating…Tinder hadn't been really out yet," the new mom to baby Wyatt, 4 months, told Kimmel. "And he was like, 'So babe, you know, I got this thing that I'm thinking about…You need to do me a favor and look at this app. Download [it].' I was like, 'No problem!'"</p><p>Kunis proceeded to download the app, which lets users like or reject other users within their radius with just a swipe of the finger.&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm on this thing going, 'What is this?!' Like, swiping things left and right," Kunis recalled. "I was like, 'This is amazing!'"</p><p>She didn't stop with Tinder, either. "This is stuff that I do at home. He makes me go on all of these websites," the Ted actress quipped of her former That '70s Show costar and love of three years. "What's the gay version of Tinder? Grindr! I've been on Grindr."&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>One invention she wasn't crazy about? BellyBeats. "You put the little microphone around the belly, and you can hear the baby's heartbeat," she explained of the device for pregnant women. "I think this is awful. Because unless you know what you're doing, you may not hear the baby's heartbeat, and then a panic ensues. It's like WebMD but bad, it's bad!"</p><p>She continued: "If your baby's, like, [at] seven months, you'll hear it anywhere. But if your baby's a little poppy seed, you really have to dig for it…Let me tell you, at three months, I was like, 'Where is it?!'"</p><p>Little Wyatt turned out to be fine, of course. Kunis gave birth back in October 2014, and she couldn't be more in love with her little one.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"It's really weird to be out," she admitted to Kimmel. "This is my very first time out and about. I left her at home yesterday for the first time during the [Jupiter Ascending] premiere. It's frightening, I have to be honest. Because I was with her every day for the first four months of her little life. I cried."</p><p></p><p>She was quick to clarify that she has no problem leaving the baby with Kutcher — just leaving the baby in general. "I trust him. He's an incredible father," she said of the Two and a Half Men star. "But the way that I hold the baby, and the way that he holds the baby? He's like a jungle gym! It's frightening."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGamoZyWeqzBzaKqZqyinrKledOipZ2domK0s7XNnalmnp%2BneqK%2Fx62mp2WbqsGktMSrZGtoYWqBc3s%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
