His goal was to explore the waters of Puget Sound, which is a water body connected to the Pacific Ocean, without having to undergo scuba diving training. The submersible he built was 12 feet long and had the capability to dive to depths of up to 30 feet.</li></ul><ul><li>In 2006, he had his first submarine dive in British Columbia.</li></ul><ul><li>He was appointed as the director of BlueView Technologies located in Washington.</li></ul><ul><li readability=-2>In 2009, after seeing a growth in underwater ocean tourism, he founded OceanGate Inc. in collaboration with&nbsp; his business partner Guillermo Söhnlein. <a href=#><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-481226 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/starsunfolded.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Stockton-Rush-with-Guillermo-Sohnlein.jpg alt="Stockton Rush with Guillermo Söhnlein" width=451 height=456 sizes="(max-width: 451px) 100vw, 451px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p id=caption-attachment-481226 class=wp-caption-text>Stockton Rush with Guillermo Söhnlein</p></li></ul><ul><li>In an interview, Stockton said that the main goal of OceanGate was to use commercial tourism as a way to generate funds for the development of deep-diving submersibles. These submersibles would have the capability to support different commercial activities, including resource mining and disaster mitigation.</li></ul><ul><li>In 2012, he established the OceanGate Foundation, a nonprofit organization to focus on advancing technology in the fields of marine science, history, and archaeology. The foundation’s primary objective was to facilitate research and exploration in these domains while providing support and resources.</li></ul><ul><li>In an interview in 2017, he expressed his desire to become the first person to go on planet Mars.</li></ul><ul><li>In 2018, he went on an expedition to the San Juan Islands alongside a team of scientists and researchers. The purpose of the expedition was to closely study sea urchins and assess any changes in the habitat of sand lance&nbsp; fish.</li></ul><ul><li>As of 2021, the cost for an individual to go on a chartered underwater expedition was approximately $250,000.</li></ul><ul><li>In 2022, Rush, along with a group of four other individuals named Renata Rojas, a banker, Oisin Fanning, a businessman, Jaden Pan, a television professional, and Steve Ross, an oceanographer, went for a descent to explore the remains of the Titanic wreckage. However, during their expedition, they faced technical challenges specifically related to the pilot’s control, which complicated their exploration of the debris.</li></ul><ul><li readability=2>During an interview, he discussed the concept of underwater ocean tourism using deep-diving submersibles and expressed that going on trips in the Titan submersible provided him with the sense of adventure he desired. He said,<br><p>It really is a life-changing experience, and there aren’t a lot of things like that. Rather than spend $65,000 to climb Mount Everest, maybe die, and spend a month living in a miserable base camp, you can change your life in a week. I wanted to be sort of the Captain Kirk. I didn’t want to be the passenger in the back. And I realized that the ocean is the universe. That’s where life is.”</p></li><li readability=1.5>According to Stockton, he was very adventurous and believed in taking risks. In an interview, he talked about this and said,<br><p>I mean if you just want to be safe, don’t get out of bed, don’t get in your car, don’t do anything. At some point, you’re going to take some risk, and it really is a risk-reward question. I think I can do this just as safely by breaking the rules.”</p></li><li readability=-1.9640287769784>On 18 June 2023, a submersible named Titan disappeared in the North Atlantic Ocean, approximately 400 nautical miles (740 km) from the coast of Newfoundland. The submersible was carrying a group of tourists, which included individuals like Hamish Harding, a businessman and explorer, Paul-Henri Nargeolet, a deep-sea explorer, <a href=# rel=noopener>Shahzada Dawood</a>, a businessman, Shahzada’s son Suleman Dawood, and Stockton Rush, the founder of OceanGate and co-pilot of Titan. They were on an expedition to observe the wreckage of the RMS Titanic. The United States military assisted in the search for the missing submersible. On 22 June 2023, it was announced that Titan had suffered an implosion, most likely during its descent, resulting in the immediate loss of all five individuals on board. <a href=#><img aria-describedby=caption-attachment-481227 decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/starsunfolded.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/An-image-of-OceanGates-Titan-submersible-under-water.jpg alt="An image of OceanGate's Titan submersible under water" width=573 height=394 sizes="(max-width: 573px) 100vw, 573px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p id=caption-attachment-481227 class=wp-caption-text>An image of OceanGate’s Titan submersible under water</p></li></ul><ul class="related_post wp_rp"><li data-position=0 data-poid=ex-in_480466 data-post-type=own_sourcefeed><a href=# class=wp_rp_thumbnail><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/starsunfolded.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Shahzada-Dawood-150x150.jpeg alt="Shahzada Dawood Age, Death, Wife, Family, Biography & More" width=150 height=150 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><a href=# class=wp_rp_title>Shahzada Dawood Age, Death, Wife, Family, Biography & More</a></li><li data-position=1 data-poid=ex-in_102846 data-post-type=own_sourcefeed><a href=# class=wp_rp_thumbnail><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/starsunfolded.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Jeff-Bezos-150x150.jpg alt="Jeff Bezos Height, Age, Wife, Children, Family, Biography & More" width=150 height=150 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><a href=# class=wp_rp_title>Jeff Bezos Height, Age, Wife, Children, Family, Biography & More</a></li><li data-position=2 data-poid=ex-in_51207 data-post-type=own_sourcefeed><a href=# class=wp_rp_thumbnail><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/starsunfolded.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Bill-Gates-150x150.jpg alt="Bill Gates Height, Age, Wife, Children, Family, Biography & More" width=150 height=150 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><a href=# class=wp_rp_title>Bill Gates Height, Age, Wife, Children, Family, Biography & More</a></li><li data-position=3 data-poid=ex-in_218613 data-post-type=own_sourcefeed><a href=# class=wp_rp_thumbnail><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/starsunfolded.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Elon-Musk-150x150.jpg alt="Elon Musk Age, Wife, Girlfriend, Children, Family, Biography & More" width=150 height=150 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><a href=# class=wp_rp_title>Elon Musk Age, Wife, Girlfriend, Children, Family, Biography & More</a></li><li data-position=4 data-poid=in-187805 data-post-type=empty><a href=# class=wp_rp_thumbnail><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/starsunfolded.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Top-10-Most-Beautiful-Punjabi-Actresses-150x150.jpg alt="Top 10 Most Beautiful Punjabi Actresses" width=150 height=150 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><a href=# class=wp_rp_title>Top 10 Most Beautiful Punjabi Actresses</a></li><li data-position=5 data-poid=in-85976 data-post-type=empty><a href=# class=wp_rp_thumbnail><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/starsunfolded.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Sharmila-Tagore1-150x150.jpg alt="Sharmila Tagore Age, Husband, Children, Family, Biography & More" width=150 height=150 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><a href=# class=wp_rp_title>Sharmila Tagore Age, Husband, Children, Family, Biography & More</a></li><li data-position=6 data-poid=in-25496 data-post-type=empty><a href=# class=wp_rp_thumbnail><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/starsunfolded.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Lennon-J-150x150.jpg alt="John Lennon Height, Weight, Age, Biography, Affairs, Favorite things & More" width=150 height=150 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><a href=# class=wp_rp_title>John Lennon Height, Weight, Age, Biography, Affairs, Favorite things & More</a></li><li data-position=7 data-poid=ex-in_321399 data-post-type=own_sourcefeed><a href=# class=wp_rp_thumbnail><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/starsunfolded.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Melinda-Gates-150x150.jpg alt="Melinda Gates Age, Boyfriend, Husband, Family, Biography & More" width=150 height=150 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><a href=# class=wp_rp_title>Melinda Gates Age, Boyfriend, Husband, Family, Biography & More</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpJa%2FtMHNn6alnJWZe6S7zGiqraeToMGwuoyrrKygXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy;
