She is blessed with an amazing figure and she works hard to maintain it. She is also great at TaeKwonDo and has earned a black belt in it. The secrets behind her great body and her fit life involve working out in the mornings, opting for the right food and having a strong idea of what wellness is. Let’s have a sneak peek at what the singer actually does to stay fit and know her thoughts on wellness.</p><h3><strong>Workout Routine</strong></h3><p>The workout regime&nbsp;of the pop princess begins in the morning. She does <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Pilates</a> or any similar workout for an hour in the mornings. She calls it a nice wake-up workout. Apart from doing Pilates in the morning, she prefers to run in the <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>afternoons</a> if she has time. She even opts for&nbsp;hiking in the afternoons. Dancing is another form of workout that keeps her in shape.</p><figure id=attachment_52526 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-52526 style=width:650px class="wp-caption aligncenter">Tinashe in her workout gear</figure><h3><strong>Breakfast Routine</strong></h3><p>The rumored girlfriend of <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Calvin Harris</a> has her breakfast at 11 AM. The meal usually consists of simple options like bacon and eggs that are converted into a sandwich. This breakfast is a good source of energy.</p><h3><strong>Meaning of Wellness</strong></h3><p>The songwriter believes wellness is a general state of health, physical and mental. Wellness is also being in a great place of overall happiness.</p><figure id=attachment_52529 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-52529 style=width:553px class="wp-caption aligncenter">Tinashe performs at M.A.C. Cosmetics SXSW party in Austin in March 2016</figure><h3><strong>Genuine Happiness and Wellness</strong></h3><p>Earlier, the record producer used to think that wellness was about nutrition and exercise only. Now, she knows that it is much more than that. It involves being in a good state of mind and doing things that really make you happy. When you are living a life in which you are genuinely happy with&nbsp;your body being&nbsp;healthy and content,&nbsp;then you have achieved true wellness.</p><h3><strong>Wellness Struggle</strong></h3><p>The Kentucky-born shares that the biggest wellness struggle she has in her life is not eating very well especially when she is on the road. Tinashe&nbsp;often has to compromise with eating late at night because she has a very busy day. She also has to eat crappy food because she has no access to healthy and good food while on the road. The workout routine of the singing sensation also messes up when she is on a tour as she cannot workout regularly due to her performances.</p><figure id=attachment_52528 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-52528 style=width:650px class="wp-caption aligncenter">Tinashe performing at Z100’s Jingle Ball 2015 in New York City</figure><h3><strong>Accountability Helps</strong></h3><p>The former model says that being accountable for anything related to fitness matters a lot. It can be either the accountability to hit the gym a few times a week or it can be eating the right meals. When you stick to a routine or schedule and make yourself more accountable, you will end up being fitter. It’s the little things that matter the most. (And we agree with her!!)</p><h3><strong>Enjoying Meditation</strong></h3><p>The actress of the film Cora Unashamed (2000) accepts that she doesn’t do meditation regularly but she enjoys it. Her mother meditates every day. The diva thinks that meditation is a great way to center yourself by giving oneself&nbsp;the room to concentrate and have thoughts.</p><figure id=attachment_52530 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-52530 style=width:500px class="wp-caption aligncenter">Tinashe at Z100’s Jingle Ball 2015 Event in New York City</figure><h3><strong>Wellness Advice</strong></h3><p>The best wellness advice shared by the musician is that you must drink a lot of <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>water</a>. You must make it your main beverage. Also, cut out the bad stuff from your diet as it would help you stay healthier.</p><h3><strong>Diet Secrets</strong></h3><p>The biggest diet secret of the singing star is to stay away from harmful food like soda, sugar, and caffeine. She says that they are all bad for you and you must give them up if you wish to stay healthy like her.</p><figure id=attachment_52527 aria-describedby=caption-attachment-52527 style=width:650px class="wp-caption aligncenter">Tinashe on the cover of Complex</figure><h3><strong>Ending the Day</strong></h3><p>The dancer ends her day by taking off all the makeup, putting on a moisturizer and braiding up her hair. These activities help her to relax in her own skin which also help her sleep better.</p><p>If you liked the workout, diet and wellness ideas shared by Tinashe, then you might want to follow her on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>Instagram</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>Twitter</a> or <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow external" data-wpel-link=external>Facebook</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jq2gp5mjnbJuw86roqitpGK%2FsMHToqWeZZSesrV50p6aq52kqHw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
