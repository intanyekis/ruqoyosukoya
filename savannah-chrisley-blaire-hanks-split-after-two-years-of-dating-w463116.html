It hurts, it does.”</p><p>Chrisley filmed the emotional footage in her bedroom. Speaking to her fans, she recalled the early stages of her relationship with Hanks.</p><p>“It’s so funny whenever I look back at Blaire and I and just the fun times we had. It truly was the definition of young love. It’s just what he and I were. We had so much fun, and things were amazing,” she said. “We were best friends.”</p><p>The now-exes have always been open about their romance, both on the USA Network series and on social media. However, Chrisley hinted that the “spotlight” may have taken a toll on them.</p><span class=caption></span><p>“It was hard to keep the relationship just to ourselves. Maybe that’s why we are at the point that we’re at now … Sometimes you can just go through so much in a relationship that it wears on you,” she explained. “It wasn’t his fault, it wasn’t my fault. There was fault on both sides.”</p><p>The news comes just one week after Chrisley <a href=#>broke her vertebra in a serious car crash.</a> She did not <a href=#>wear her neck brace</a> in her video on Wednesday night.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasmaaWu6%2Btx2aaoaqZqLmmxYybo5qhopp6qa3NpKpmq6ChtrV5wJ%2BrnqpdqcSwediemKurXaSzbrDAraCnn12sgXd%2FkGptaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
