He then got down on one knee and proposed to Jahira. On his Instagram page, Cesar posted images from the passionate encounter.</p><p>Behind the couple, the violinist played as Cesar gave Jahira a large bouquet of pink roses adorned with exquisite eucalyptus branches. In an interview with People in 2016, Millan stated, “I wanted the proposal to be exceptional and to surprise her, so I spent months organizing our trip to Greece. I am still proud of myself that I never gave anything away!”</p><p>Cesar used to follow and comment on his fiancée’s Instagram posts, but when she put a new picture there in May 2017, he didn’t do either, which alarmed their followers. They began to inquire about the state of their relationship, but neither Jahira nor Cesar answered; there had been no recent developments regarding their impending nuptials.</p><h2><span id=How_did_Jahira_Dar_start_her_Professional_Career>How did Jahira Dar start her Professional Career?</span></h2><p>Former stylist and wardrobe consultant, Jahira.
