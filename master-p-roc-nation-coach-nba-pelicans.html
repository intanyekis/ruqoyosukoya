The established rap star and leader of the No Limit Soldiers has been forthright with his desire to head the New Orleans Pelicans. Now, he's taking the necessary steps to make that a reality.</p><p>While walking through Beverly Hills, P (real name Percy Robert Miller) was asked about his plans by TMZ. It was there that he revealed that he's now signed with Roc Nation, an established sports agency. Making this announcement even more newsworthy is that Master P isn't simply signed to the agency, but lead by the two most prominent agents there.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Jumpshots & Buzz Cuts: Why JayR Mallari Is Barber To The NBA Stars</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Right now, I just hired a sports agent," he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a>. “One of the best in the world, The Raymond Brothers. He's the President of Basketball for Roc Nation. He's a good friend of mine and he knows what he's doing."</p><p>The Raymond Brothers aren't the only ones who know what they're doing. It appears that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Master P does as well</a>. Not only is he making a run at glory, but it's a path that he's been clearly planning for a while now. Earlier this month, he spoke openly about his aspirations to coach in the NBA. Once again, it was TMZ hearing it all firsthand.</p><p>"I think it’s time," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he told the site</a>. "They gotta do something different, unique. You look at Tim Tebow, they brought him to play as a tight end because they looking at times is changing. The NBA is entertainment. I think it’s time for me to be the first Hip Hop coach. Because what I know as basketball, I played in the NBA, I done coached a lot of great players that are in the league. I done took my sons from being high school athletes to maybe they’ll be the next future big-time pro athletes. I coached DeMar DeRozan, a lot of great players.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He went on to speak about his style and how he could help change the direction of the team. According to the hopeful coach, it's all about motivation and understanding.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Since the 1990s</a>, Master P has been a fixture of New Orleans, which makes a potential NBA entrance for the team even more fitting. He's been&nbsp; honored many times over for his musical career and helping others reach their goals. However, he's also branched out into other areas including movies, WCW Wrestling, and different forms of entertainment.</p><p>The lifted-by-the-bootstraps story that Master P has told for decades is one of inspiration. Today, he's worth an estimated $200 Million. For a star with that type of fortune, it would be nothing to do nothing going forward. Resting on your laurels becomes a genuine option. However, for Miller, it isn't. The desire to keep on keeping on keeps him going and, if he and Roc Nation see things through, he might be flying with the Pelicans soon enough.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>NBA All-Star Anthony Davis Buys $32 Million Bel-Air Mansion</a></span></p><p>Sources:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NPR</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hip Hop DX</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS6or%2FTnqlmqF2nvKR5zZqroqeeYrCwrcKhZKeakWK9prjInJinq18%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
