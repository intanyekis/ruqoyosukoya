He managed to claim the golden ticket of having the most top ten singles to reach the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 in a year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Global News</a>, the classic band known as The Beatles could not be beaten in this category since 1964. During their reign, they had&nbsp;11 Top 10 singles. However, Drake just narrowly beat them by one song recently.</p><p>Some of Drake's top performers are the child of collaborations. This is the case with a few songs from "Scorpion", his latest album. Other pieces that are number one spots are known as "Nice for What",&nbsp; "In My Feelings", and "Godâ€™s Plan".</p><p>Drake did get some celebratory hooray&nbsp;from his fans via Twitter. One user basically compared him to popular professional soccer player known as&nbsp;Leo Messi.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>DRAKE & CARDI B TOP SPOTIFY'S MOST STREAMED SONGS OF THE SUMMER</a>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The pat on the back didn't stop there. He even got a text from what he considers his favorite high school teacher.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, this was a big achievement but it is safe to assume that everyone kind of knew it was going to happen, if not by him, likely another big-time star. The Beatles could not hold that position since people's tastes have&nbsp;changed over the years, they've also stopped producing songs, which means that they can't compete with the pace of Drake or other modern artists.</p><p>While there's a ton of positivity around this, you can't really compare the Beatles and Drake because they're from very different time periods. Drake also has the advantage of streaming, which can enable someone to listen to the same song countless times over again, which could bring his songs up to number one all the time, if enough people did it that is.</p><p>This isn't even the first record that Drake has beat. Earlier this year he became the first artist to spend the largest amount of time at the number one spot. That time around, he beat Usher.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>No one really knows how he's doing this but it's clear that he is going for more than one spot in the top lists, which means he's going to be remembered for a very long time due to his legendary&nbsp;amount of awards for being a top artist.</p><p><strong>NEXT: <a href=#>DRAKE TOPPLES TAYLOR SWIFT'S SPOTIFY RECORD</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nlKeurLGMm5yarKNir6at06WcrGWSnrmtrs6aqZ1lYWV9br7EnKarnF8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
