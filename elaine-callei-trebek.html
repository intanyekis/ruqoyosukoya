Whatsoever, she became the talk the town after marrying a popular Canadian-American TV personality, <strong>George Alexander Trebek</strong>, aka <a href=#><strong>Alex Trebek</strong></a>. Currently, she owns and manages an art gallery named <i>Gallery GO</i>.</p><p>The ex-wife of Alex, Elaine, was born in Columbus, Ohio, the USA. She belongs to the white ethnic background, and her nationality is American. She is a graduate of Ohio State University in journalism. For now, people are curious to know about her marriage in the present day.</p><h2>Current Husband: Peter Kares</h2><p>The businesswoman, Elaine, married <strong>Peter Kares</strong> after divorcing with <a href=#><strong>Alex Trebek</strong></a>. Peter and Elaine exchanged their wedding vows after 19 years of Elaine's divorce, which was on <i>18 March 2001</i>, and their marriage ceremony was held privately between their close ones.&nbsp;</p><p>For now, the couple is living happily and low-key life without divorce rumours and controversies concerning their love life. It has been 18 years of their marital experience, but they do not share children. Maybe, the two are planning to share a baby as soon as possible.</p><h2>Previous Marriages And Divorce</h2><p>Elaine married thrice in her lifetime. Initially, she was in a marital relationship with <strong>Louis Callei</strong>, with whom she moved to Canada. Whatsoever, she has been very secretive towards her first marriage. From her bonding with Louis, she has a daughter named <strong>Nicky</strong>. Unfortunately, the two parted their ways in 1974 just like <a href=#>Janette Olsen</a>.</p><p>After her first divorce, she got romantically involved with Alex Trebek, who is a prominent American Host and TV personality. They tied the knot on <i>13 May 1974</i>, the same year she divorced with Louis. The two first met each other at <i>CBC </i>(Canadian Broadcasting Company), where they used to work together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/12/23/Elaine-Trebek-Kares-pro%20(1)-1577067943449.jpg><p>Like her first marriage, her conjugal relationship with Alex turns out to be a failure as they parted their ways after seven years. To be exact, they officially divorced in 1981. The couple does not share any children, but he became the adoptive father to her daughter, Nicky.</p><h2>Know A Little About Elaine's Ex-Spouse, Alex Trebek</h2><p>Alex is a TV personality who is known for hosting the critically acclaimed game show, <i>Jeopardy</i>!. Likewise, he has also hosted a couple of popular game shows, such as <i>The Wizard of Odds, Battlestars</i>, and <i>Classic Concentration</i>. Reportedly, he announced that he is suffering from stage four pancreatic cancer, which left millions of fans and his families in sadness.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/12/23/alex-trebek-1014x570%20(1)-1577068054244.jpg><p>Currently, Alex is married to <a href=#><strong>Jean Currivan Trebek</strong></a>, who is a real estate project manager from New York.
