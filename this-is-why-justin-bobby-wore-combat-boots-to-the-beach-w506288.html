They would implement that and they’d have Audrina bring her helmet so we could do arriving and departing scenes and then obviously I’m taking off by myself or with my boys on the Harley without her. So it’s like, oh, perfect opportunity to seem like he left her.”</p><p>He added: “But none of that was true at all, I would never do that.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>Brescia, 35, also opened up about his current relationship with Patridge, 32, amid her <a href=#>divorce from <b>Corey Bohan</b>. </a>“I’m literally chatting with Audrina right now,” <a href=#>he said</a>. “We’re talking because I made a comment about what was happening with her divorce. She had reached out to me and kind of thanked me for being nice and a friend about the whole thing.”</p><p>The former couple has remained close, Brescia said, because their friendship began organically rather than through the show’s producers. “There was always a fairly grand mutual respect and consideration for each other, just because we were friends before anything,” he explained on the podcast. “We weren’t pushed together by the show.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>He added: “We had a little bond and trust within each other.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatoJmoeqq%2FjLCfsmWaqsC1tc1mmaiakq56uLvRnmScp52XrrV5waimratdqbxuwMeeZJudkZi1bsOUaW1rcGhk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
