She passed away on the scene.</span></span></p><p><span><span>First responders arrived around 9:45 PM on December 21st after receiving reports of the devastating accident near Albatross Road. According to highway patrol, a northbound Ford F-150 veered into the rear of Pack’s 2024 moped as it overturned from the collision impact.</span></span></p><p><span><strong><span>“The tremendous force of the truck slamming into the moped caused it to flip, fatally injuring the female passenger,” said patrol sergeant Tim Morgan.</span></strong><span>&nbsp;The male moped driver survived with severe injuries and was rushed to the hospital by first responders.</span></span></p><p><span><span>A makeshift memorial now lines SC-183 where Pack heartbreakingly perished a week before Christmas, leaving five grieving children without their doting mother.

Pack’s family describes her as “a free spirit” who could also light up any room with her humor and generosity.</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>Tragically, Pack perished unexpectedly in her prime, forced to leave her precious babies behind without their caring mother’s guidance. Yet her luminous legacy shall not fade even in physical absence. May Kerry Pack’s vibrant memory live on through the children she cherished most.</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>Seeking Justice, Promoting Road Safety</span></span></span></p><p><span><span><span>As the holiday season continues casting gloom over an inconsolable family, SC Highway Patrol diligently investigates the exact circumstances of Pack’s heartbreaking moped crash.
