Professional golfer <a href=#><strong>Jason Day</strong></a> and his wife, <strong>Ellie Harvey</strong>, tied the knot in 2009 after two years of dating.</p><p>The twosome met in 2005 when Day walked into a restaurant <a href=#>where Harvey was waitressing</a>, but they didn’t go on their first date until two years later. During an August 2015 interview with the <a href=# rel=noopener>Mansfield News Journal</a>, Ellie’s father, <strong>Tom Harvey</strong>, admitted that he was apprehensive of the athlete at first.</p><p>“I <a href=#>had my dad hat on</a> and cautioned [Ellie],” he told the outlet. “Strike one, he’s a jock. Strike two, he’s a professional. And strike three, he’s from Australia. I exaggerated it as much as I could, but [she] blew her old man off. I told her to go in with eyes wide open.”</p><p>Despite her father’s warnings, Ellie and Day <a href=#>exchanged vows</a> in October 2009. “I don’t mind admitting I was wrong [about Jason],” Tom said in 2015, noting that he and his son-in-law had since <a href=#>formed “a real good relationship.”</a></p><p>The married couple, for their part, went on to <a href=#>welcome four kids together</a>: son Dash, born in 2012, daughter Lucy, born in 2015, son Arrow, born in 2019, and son Oz Niro, born in 2021. Ellie also <a href=#>suffered a miscarriage</a> in November 2017, which she opened up about via Instagram one month later.</p><p>“I found out the baby had no heartbeat anymore. I was devastated,” she revealed in the emotional post. “Initially I felt complete despair. And then I saw the baby. … When I saw it, I felt God so much I can’t explain it. I felt seen and known.”</p><p>The Ohio native celebrated <a href=#>the ups and downs</a> she and Day have shared together while commemorating their wedding anniversary with an October 2022 Instagram post.</p><p>“Ten days late but … thirteen years. Four sweet babies with us, one in heaven. Tons of surreal highs and plenty of deep heartaches. Wins and losses. Silly fights and lots of learning. Extra lbs and extra wrinkles but <a href=#>SO much love has been the fruit of this marriage</a>. Very thankful for it all. @jasondayofficial,” she captured a photo of herself smiling with her hand on the Australia native’s chest.</p><p>In addition to <a href=#>raising a family together</a>, Ellie also celebrates Day’s sports career, often walking to every hole when her husband plays golf.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I like to see what’s going on, but it’s become more difficult because the (galleries) are bigger and it’s frustrating because I can’t see,” she told the Mansfield News Journal in 2015. “It’s good for him because <a href=#>he’s always scanning the crowd for me</a>.”</p><p>Keep scrolling for a look at Ellie and Day’s relationship over the years:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkt6K%2FzqdknZmpYq6vsIywoJ%2BdXZq5rbXEZp%2BaqqaaxrR50Z6jmqyZpLu0tMipZK2hnZq5qrrEaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
