This Levy-original focused on a family that put material above all else, watching their sudden crash from grace into the small town of Schitt’s Creek. While the premise itself sounded entertaining enough, it was the emotional and heartwarming journey of the characters and their growth that kept audiences coming back. While Schitt’s Creek lives on in continuous binge sessions (and the hearts of the audience), the cast has since stepped into the limelight to explore their own careers. Here’s what they’ve been up to since wrapping that finale episode.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dan-levy-is-heading-back-to-high-school><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Dan Levy Is Heading Back To High School</span></h2><p>Dan Levy swept the nation with his work on Schitt’s Creek, earning an armful of awards by the end of the show’s run. Since ending with a fond farewell to his dear characters, the actor has gone full steam ahead in trying his hand at new roles. Kicking off by co-writing Best Wishes, Warmest Regards: The Story of Schitt’s Creek with his father, Levy has also added hosting SNL to the resume alongside roles in production, working with Netflix and HBO Max on separate projects. Levy made headlines as he joined Kristen Stewart on screen in Happiest Season, and as of August 2022, it was announced that he was<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> joining the cast of Sex Education for season 4</a>. Safe to say he’s keeping busy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=eugene-levy-is-reluctantly-on-the-move><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Eugene Levy Is Reluctantly On The Move</span></h2><p>Eugene Levy is far from new to the world of fame, so the actor has been taking things easy since wrapping up his latest series. Joining forces with his son on the behind-the-scenes Schitt’s Creek book, Levy has also stepped out on his own to appear in Star-Crossed: The Film. Levy’s biggest upcoming event will be with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple TV+ in The Reluctant Traveller</a>. The docu-series is set to follow Levy, who admittedly isn’t a fan of trips, as he journeys across the world. Though no dates have been announced, Levy will serve not only as the unscripted host of the show but also as a producer for the series.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara, And The Other Stars Who Got Their Start On SCTV</a></span></p><h2 id=catherine-o-rsquo-hara-is-set-to-spy><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Catherine O’Hara Is Set To Spy</span></h2><p>Moira Rose may have struggled to find her fans on Schitt’s Creek, but the character and actress behind her certainly did not. Since wrapping on Schitt’s Creek and <a href=#>putting away her final Moira Rose wig</a>, O’Hara has been keeping herself busy in the world of voice work. Appearing in Extinct, The Last Kids on Earth, and Central Park, O’Hara’s been flexing her vocal skills to really sell each character. Those who miss seeing her face can relax as she’s set to appear in Argylle alongside Bryce Dallas Howard, Bryan Cranston, and Henry Cavill to follow the world’s greatest spy and the adventures that ensue.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=annie-murphy-shows-off-her-acting-chops><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Annie Murphy Shows Off Her Acting Chops</span></h2><p>It’s difficult to really nail a comedy role and move away from such an established character, but Annie Murphy stepped away from Alexis Rose in an instant. While she still <a href=#>adores her big break character</a>, she couldn’t wait to show off her dramatic abilities, starring in the dark comedy Kevin Can F**k Himself. Of course, she hasn’t stepped totally away from comedic styling as she’s also taken time to appear in Murderville alongside Will Arnett to show off her improv skills. Murphy’s also taken some time to join Russian Doll, appearing in the second season as the younger Ruth Brenner. She’s just getting started in really showing audiences what she can do.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Facts About 'Schitt's Creek' Star Annie Murphy And What She's Up To Now</a></span></p><h2 id=emily-hampshire-defies-genres><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Emily Hampshire Defies Genres</span></h2><p>Following her time as <a href=#>slacker Stevie Budd</a>, Emily Hampshire immediately jumped back in time to star in Chapelwaite with Adrien Brody. Horror and mystery seem to be her things as Hampshire is also starring in the new series The Rig which follows a group on a Scottish rig, cut off from communication with danger surrounding them. Hampshire is also taking some time with drama in The Mattachine Family, The End of Sex, and Bloody Hell. She’s also taken a step into voice work, appearing on the fiction podcast The Beautiful Liar. There’s a lot slotted for release in the next few years alone, so there are no worries about Emily Hampshire keeping busy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=noah-reid-brings-his-best-to-broadway><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Noah Reid Brings His Best To Broadway</span></h2><p>Patrick Brewer may not have started with the Schitt’s Creek gang, but the character brought a turning point in the series and became part of a couple that defined the show. Noah Reid’s charisma, charm, and stunning voice (no one can forget him serenading David with “The Best”) all won over the audience, solidifying him as a fan favorite. Since wrapping on the series, he’s taken some time to follow passion projects of his own. In addition to getting married and having a kid (kind of a big deal), Noah Reid has joined Josh Brolin and Imogen Poots in Outer Range. Following the thriller, he stepped aside from the screen and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">took to Broadway, starring in The Minutes </a>while working on his third studio album, Adjustments.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Noah Reid Felt About Playing Dan Levy's Boyfriend On 'Schitt's Creek'</a></span></p><h2 id=sarah-levy-senses-the-supernatural><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Sarah Levy Senses The Supernatural</span></h2><p>After playing it up as airhead Twyla Sands for six years on Schitt’s Creek, Sarah Levy is ready to face the world with another set of unique characters. Taking on the world of the paranormal, Levy has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">stepped into SurrealEstate</a>, a series following a team of specialists who handle haunted homes for sale. To escape the drama of the supernatural, she’s also taken on Distancing Socially, a movie starring Alan Tudyk and her husband, Graham Outerbridge, that portrays how life moved on during Covid lockdown. Levy is set to taking the starring role on screen again in Patty’s Auto, a comedy about a female auto repair shop.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dustin-milligan-keeps-up-with-comedy><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Dustin Milligan Keeps Up With Comedy</span></h2><p>Dustin Milligan’s character Ted underwent a wild transformation on Schitt’s Creek going from the too-perfect passable man Alexis ignored to being her love she had to leave. Following the path of his character, Dustin Milligan has been following his passion for comedy work, joining Ed Helms and Jesse Leigh in the small town of Rutherford Falls. Of course, Milligan isn’t just sticking to one show - he’s also venturing out to share the screen in The People We Hate at the Wedding with Kristen Bell and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mack & Rita alongside Diane Keaton</a>. Basically, he’s keeping himself busy as the wholesome romantic lead everyone loves.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYsGpsYysmqGhpKnAbq%2FRnpykZZOWwLV5x5qqZpqVmrtusM6ipaBlo567pLGMrZ%2BeZaOdvLh5xKebnpxf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
