However, Biel noted that she wasn’t an adult on the drama. She was only 14 when the show began in 1996, while Watson was 22.</p><p>“He was dating, like, real-life women. We were 14 years old,” she said. “There was no chance for us. It was not happening.”</p><p>In 2016, Mitchell, 40, confirmed their crushes on her blog, <a href=#>Growing Up Hollywood</a>. “I am pretty sure every teenage girl had a crush on Barry, I mean look at him. Jess and I did for a minute. I mean it really isn’t fair that he had better hair,” she wrote at the time.</p><p>While the women were just kids when they started their Hollywood careers, Biel admitted that she isn’t so sure <a href=#>she wants sons</a> Silas, 6, and Phineas, 11 months, to follow in her and dad <a href=#><strong>Justin Timberlake</strong></a>‘s footsteps.</p><p>“My knee-jerk reaction is ‘Oh, God no. Oh, please no,’” the Sinner star told Shepard when asked about Silas and Phineas’ future careers in the industry. “But then I look at these kids and I’m like, ‘Oh s–t, they’ll probably be musical.’ What are you going to do? Not let them play the piano or not let take a voice lesson if that’s their passion?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Jessica-Biel-Admits-Crush-On-7th-Heaven-Costar-0004.jpg><p>Biel’s parents didn’t stand in her way when she wanted to get her career started, and she thinks she’ll follow their example — if she really has to.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I don’t want to be that parent to stifle a dream, but man, if my kid would just be, like, ‘Let’s go learn about corn in Iowa,’ I would so much more want them to be an engineer or something,” the actress divulged.</p><p>Luckily, the Limetown alum doesn’t have to worry about her sons’ career paths just yet. The working mom is focused on her production company, Iron Ocean, and <a href=#>their latest hit, Cruel Summer</a>. Freeform renewed the series for a second season on Tuesday, June 15, hours before the finale airs at 10 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGeq6OesKJ5waKcpWWYlrFurYycqa6rmGK8r3mWrZ9moJWWw6a60maZmqqirnq4rdOspqdn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
