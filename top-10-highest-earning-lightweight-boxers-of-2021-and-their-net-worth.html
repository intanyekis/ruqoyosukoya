The prime years of legendary lightweights like Floyd Mayweather, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Manny Pacquiao,</a> Oscar De La Hoya, Julio Cesar Chavez, and Sugar Ray Leonard are now legendary feats of the past. But now, there is a new generation of hungry, innovative, game-changing fighters who are rising to the occasion. We'll take a look at the top 10 highest-earning lightweight boxers of 2021 and how they're shaking up the boxing world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=gervonta-davis>Gervonta Davis</h2><p>Gervonta Davis, appropriately named Tank, is an American boxer from Baltimore, MD, who began his career in 2017 as a super-featherweight division. Tank signed to <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Floyd 'Money' Mayweather's Mayweather Promotions</a> in 2015 after he was sought after by Floyd, who saw Gervonta as extremely entertaining. He won his first championship against Jose Pedraza in 2017 and <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">was awarded the IBF Super Featherweight title</a>. Then, in 2018, Davis won the WBA Super World Super Featherweight Title. A year later, in 2019, he moved up in weight class to the lightweight division and won the WBA Lightweight title after defeating Yuriorkis Gamboa, enabling him to hold two belts simultaneously in two different weight classes. His dominating boxing resume of 25 wins, 0 losses, and 24 knockouts awarded him a net worth of $4 million and a luxurious lifestyle, just like his promoter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=george-kambosos>George Kambosos</h2><p>Undaunted by the fact that he is not considered a part of the 'Four Kings' of the lightweight division (Gervonta Davis, Teofimo Lopez, Vasyl Lomachenko, and Devin Haney),<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> George Kambosos continues to press on and shock the world of boxing.</a> The Australian warrior is the definition of an underdog, and at 20 wins, 0 losses, and 0 draws, is showing no signs of stopping. He recently won a split decision over the hard-hitting Teofimo Lopez, who lost his WBA, WBO, and IBF lightweight belts to Kambosos. His net worth currently sits at $1.5 million and is expected to grow, and he will now be hunted for the title belts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=teofimo-lopez>Teofimo Lopez</h2><p>Developing a passion for boxing at the age of six, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Teofimo Lopez </a>grew a liking to the sport after observing his father and present coach, Lopez Sr., train for boxing matches. Lopez also came in as an underdog, steadily climbing the ranks in the boxing world and displayed the skill, speed, and punching power to be the next boxing superstar. <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">His greatest upset win was against Vasyl 'Hi-Tech' Lomachenko</a>, a Ukrainian beast who was recognized as the most skilled fighter in the lightweight division. Lopez won by unanimous decision, bringing his boxing resume to 16 wins and 0 losses. However, his undefeated streak was broken after fighting George Kambosos, who won by unanimous decision. His net worth as of 2021 sits at $2.5 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=vasyl-lomachenko>Vasyl Lomachenko</h2><p>He's not called 'Hi-Teck' as a loose-fitting nickname. Before entering the boxing world professionally, Vasyl Lomachenko's amateur career included 2 <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Olympic Gold Medal wins.</a> His superior boxing ability, footwork, and ring IQ awarded him a title fight in only his second professional fight. He went on to dominate his opponents with synchronized hand speed and coordination. However, his first loss came while fighting for the vacant WBO Featherweight title against Orlando Salido. He then ascended to the super featherweight division and won the WBO title, and later won the WBA Lightweight Title. However, in 2020 Lomachenko was stopped by Teofimo Lopez, who won by unanimous decision. Vasyl Lomachenko has a net worth of $10 million, but it doesn't all come from boxing. He has endorsements with the <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">luxury menswear brand, Billionaire, as well as his own watch brand called Loma Watch.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=luke-campbell>Luke Campbell</h2><p>Luke Campbell is a British professional boxer who began his professional boxing career after winning the <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Olympic gold</a> at the London 2012 Games. His first legitimate professional boxing match came in 2013 against Andy Harris. He went on an undefeated streak for his next ten fights before <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">claiming the WBC International Lightweight title,</a> which he lost four months later to the French boxer Yvan Mendy. In all, he held a record of 20 professional wins, 10 of which came by knockout and four losses. In July 2021, Campbell announced his retirement from boxing at age 33, claiming that he had accomplished his biggest dream already, which was winning The Olympic Gold Medal in 2012. During his career, he received two world title shots against Jorge Linares and Vasyl Lomachenko and lost both by decision. However, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the boxer still boasts an impressive net worth</a> of $8 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jorge-linares>Jorge Linares</h2><p>Fighting out of Venezuela and possibly the most experienced fighter on the list at 35-years old, Jorge Linares has an impressive boxing record of 47 wins, six losses, and 29 knockouts throughout his fighting career from super bantamweight, featherweight, super featherweight, lightweight, and light-welterweight. Linares has held the WBC Lightweight title and the WBA Lightweight title. However, he lost the WBA Lightweight belt to Vasyl Lomachenko, who won by a TKO. Despite his loss, he is credited as the only fighter to knock down Lomachenko. Linares has a net worth of $1 million, which is 2016, was estimated at $5.5 million.</p><h2 id=javier-fortuna>Javier Fortuna</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Some of boxing's toughest fighters, such as <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Canelo Alvarez, </a>come from places like Mexico, Venezuela, The Philippines, and The Dominican Republic. Another heavy-hitter in the lightweight division is Dominican-born Javier Fortuna, whose professional boxing career began in 2011 after winning the WBA Youth Intercontinental Featherweight Championship by knockout. A promising prospect, Fortuna reigned as the super featherweight WBA world champion from 2015. He then moved up to the lightweight division, where he unsuccessfully challenged Robert Easter Jr. for the IBF Lightweight title. Despite the losses, he was victorious in his last three bouts before being scheduled to fight Luke Campbell and Jorge Linares in 2020, but those fights were <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic</a>. Still in the prime of his career, Fortuna has generated a net worth of $4 million.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=#> Top 10 Boxers With The Highest Net Worths</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ryan-garcia>Ryan Garcia</h2><p>At only 23 years old, Ryan 'The King' Garcia has pulled off an impressive record of 20 wins, 18 by way of knockout, 0 losses, and 0 draws. His last victory came by technical knockout against the British boxer, Luke Campbell, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">where he picked up the WBC International Lightweight title.</a> Garcia has expanded his fan base and boxing presence outside the ring and took up acting. In 2019, 'King Ry' began his own series on Netflix called On The Ropes. He has been signed to<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Oscar De La Hoya's Golden Boy Promotions</a> since 2016, placing his overall net worth at $10 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=richard-commey>Richard Commey</h2><p>Richard Commey is a Ghananian boxer with an impressive record of 33 fights, 30 wins, 27 by way of knockout, and three defeats. One of those <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">losses came at the hands of Teofimo Lopez in a TKO in the second round,</a> which caused Commey to vacate his IBF lightweight title to Lopez. At 34 years old, the lightweight boxer earned a Ghananian title from 2011, an ABU title in 2013, a Commonwealth titleholder from 2014-2015. In 2019, he made history as the first <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">African-born boxer</a> to hold the IBF Lightweight title. With most of his income generated through boxing, his net worth sits at $10 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=devin-haney>Devin Haney</h2><p>Devin "The Dream" Haney has been called many names as one of the youngest boxers in the lightweight division, everything from "Pillow Hands" to "Ducker." But despite the criticism he has received for having no punching power, Haney has proved he belongs in the <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">lightweight division</a> with a record of 27 wins, 15 knockouts, and 0 losses. His most recent victory took place over Jojo Diaz on November 4, 2021, which he won by unanimous decision. He is now determined to fight George Kambosos, who now holds the WBA, WBO, and IBF lightweight belts. 'The Dream' Haney now has a net worth of $5 million following his victory against Jojo Diaz.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>Top 10 Longest-Reigning Heavyweight Champions In Boxing History</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sporting News,</a>&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DAZN News,</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;The Athletic,</a>&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sports Unfold</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBsLyMamdmoJmctaa%2F02acmqqenruoecuinqGsp5q2qLTTZpmosJWnwG67xWZpaWphYq6vsIytn56homK7psCMsKarrJhk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
