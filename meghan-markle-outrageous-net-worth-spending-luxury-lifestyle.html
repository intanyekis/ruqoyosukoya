In a candid interview with Yahoo! Life in 2019, she offered a word of caution to the talented actress-turned-royal.</p><p>"What I think that Meghan has to be careful of is that she’s both an A-list celebrity and a senior royal.

With her success in showbiz, it's no surprise that reports estimated her pre-marriage wealth at around $5 million. However, their decision to step back as senior royals did not alter their combined net worth of $60 million, as that figure represents their independent fortunes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/What-Is-Prince-Harry--Meghan-Markles-Role-In-King-Charles-IIIs-Coronation.jpg><p>Since their departure from royal duties, Meghan and Harry have shouldered a greater financial burden.
