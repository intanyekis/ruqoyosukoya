American Horror Story: Double Feature is divided into two distinct parts - Red Tide and Death Valley, with the former taking place by the sea and the latter by the sand.</p><p>In Double Feature, creator Ryan Murphy welcomes back some of his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">most common AHS collaborators</a>, such as Sarah Paulson, Evan Peters, Billie Lourd, Finn Witrock, Lily Rabe, and Adina Porter. But one particular newcomer has fans excited - Macaulay Culkin is <a href=#>making his debut in the AHS universe</a>! The beloved Home Alone actor took a long break from Hollywood before returning to acting, with sporadic roles in TV shows such as Robot Chicken and The Jim Gaffigan Show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite a break from acting that included <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">creating a satirical website</a> and appearing in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Assistant parody ad</a>, Culkin remains one of the wealthiest cast members of American Horror Story: Double Feature. So how do his co-stars stack up?</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's Why Macaulay Culkin Joined The American Horror Story Cast</a></span></p><h2 id=billie-lourd---20-million><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Billie Lourd - $20 million</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/billie-lourd-acting-scream-queens.jpg><p>As the daughter of the late Carrie Fisher and granddaughter of the late Debbie Reynolds, there is no denying that Billie Lourd comes from a family of Hollywood legends. Though acting may be in her genes, Billie has made a name for herself with starring roles in Scream Queens, Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Star Wars: The Last Jedi, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, Booksmart, and previous seasons of AHS. Billie is also the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sole heir of her mother’s estate</a>, which includes valuable property and assets.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=macaulay-culkin---18-million><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Macaulay Culkin - $18 million</span></h2><p>Macaulay Culkin may have been one of the most recognizable faces of '90s children’s movies, but his career as a child actor also broke salary records - he was paid 4.5 million for his role in Home Alone 2: Lost in New York, which was the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">biggest salary ever for an eleven-year-old</a> at the time. AHS marks his first return to the screen since 2019’s Changeland.</p><h2 id=sarah-paulson---12-million><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Sarah Paulson - $12 million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sarah Paulson may be one of Ryan Murphy’s most frequent AHS collaborators, but she is no stranger to high-profile roles outside of Murphy’s universe. Paulson has been acting since 1994, and has appeared in Law & Order, Desperate Housewives, Grey’s Anatomy, Mrs. America, Ratched, and American Crime Story. Her talents have also been featured on the big screen in movies such as Bird Box, 12 Years a Slave, Ocean’s 8, Run, The Post, and Carol.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Facts About Sarah Paulson's Most Controversial 'American Horror Story' Roles</a></span></p><h2 id=finn-wittrock---5-million><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Finn Wittrock - $5 million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Finn Wittrock began his acting career with appearances in Cold Case, ER, and CSI: Miami, and became a familiar face with a starring role on All My Children in 2011.
