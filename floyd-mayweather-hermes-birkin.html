It is being reported that the boxer spent about a quarter of a million dollars on a 4 pack of designer bags.</p><p>The cost breakdown of each bag is as follows. The limited edition white crocodile is priced at a whopping $125,000. Both the black and red solid crocodile bags cost $35,000 a piece. Finally, there is the ostrich bag, which also has a price tag of $35,000. That means Mayweather’s total price tag is $230,000 for four handbags. It is a crazy amount of money to spend on purses—even they are the infamous Hermes bags.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>SHOCKING&nbsp;FACTS ABOUT FLOYD MAYWEATHER</a></strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As for what lucky lady <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mayweather</a> was buying these fabulous bags for, that remains to be seen. Although he is rumored to be dating former TOWIE star Abigail Clarke, the couple has not confirmed their relationship status. She was also not with him when he made the purchases. However, some unknown woman was by his side as he left the store. Whoever is the beneficiary of these awesome handbags is one lucky lady that is for sure.</p><p>It has been almost two weeks since Floyd Mayweather walked away with a cool $300 million after he beat <a href=#>Conor McGregor</a> in the ring. The boxer was not shy about revealing just how much money he made for the fight. In fact, the $300 million was the number he threw out before the fight even happened. There is a good chance he walked away with even more cash than that. He was also very vocal about wanting to secure the highest payday in boxing history. It looks like he just might have done that for his 50th<a href=#>fight</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What do you think about the professional boxer shelling out almost a $250,000 on handbags?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmm62qr3ynuM6ym2alka7Epq3ToZyrZZiav66x0maZoqqbnrtw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
