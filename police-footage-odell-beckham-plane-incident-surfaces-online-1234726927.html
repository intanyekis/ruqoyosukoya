Footage of the altercation surfaced online on Wednesday (Jan. 11) that adds a bit more context to the situation.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><a href=# rel=nofollow>WPLG Local 10 News</a> in Florida obtained the video, which begins right when the police officers board the Sunday morning flight following Thanksgiving. The news broadcaster stated that the flight crew described the <a href=#>Super Bowl</a> winner as “belligerent” and that he told them he was “sleeping hard” because he was tired from traveling and out clubbing the previous evening.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Do you know how many times we’ve shaken him to put his seatbelt on?” the flight attendant asked the officers, in reference to the three-time Pro Bowler. “If you don’t want him to fly, that’s a decision that you guys are going to have to make,” one of the officers replied.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The authority then approached the former Los Angeles Rams wide receiver and told him he would need to leave, clarifying that it was not his decision to which Beckham replied “I’ve never had this happen to me.” The broadcaster says he was downplaying the situation and refusing to leave, which caused the captain to return to the gate and ordered the father of one to exit.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Odell’s continual refusal forced all passengers to de-board. The officer explained that to Beckham Jr., and the former LSU Tiger replied “That’s fine.” An angry passenger made a comment toward him, and he firmly replied “That sh*t don’t mean nothing to me.” Another video snippet shows the star <a href=#>NFL </a>player telling another passenger “You’re going to wait 40 minutes and I’m going to be on a private plane home.” The passenger replied “Good,” and Odell countered “Yeah, with your fat a**.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Police officers reported that the 2014 NFL Offensive Rookie Of The Year seemed sick, the WPLG broadcaster said. Beckham Jr.’s attorney believed that the crew was at fault for the incident. Unfortunately, there is no footage of his interactions with the flight crew prior to the police entering the flight that can ascertain what actually occurred.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Odell Beckham Jr. was in the midst of traveling to his planned <a href=# rel=nofollow>meetings with NFL teams</a> as he was still a free agent. Two of the meetings were with the Dallas Cowboys and <a href=#>Buffalo Bills</a>, who ultimately went in different directions and instead signed T.Y. Hilton and Cole Beasley, respectively.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The Cowboys, who were once very vocal about their interest in bringing in the star receiver, cited <a href=# rel=nofollow>“medicals” and “financial demands”</a> as their reason for not signing him. Beckham Jr. is still in the midst of recovering from a torn ACL that forced him out of Super Bowl LVI.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6W8rbXCnmSfp5%2BprqixjKibnqScYq%2Bmr8qhmKZloKGur7GMoqWcoZSau7V50q6pn5mTmsBuu82loKedXWZ%2FdICWa21yamdk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
