I’m annoyed as well that I’m sick again because this is red wine weather,” Adele explained to the crowd at The Colosseum Caesar Palace on Wednesday, November 8, per <a href=# rel=noopener>Daily Mail</a>. “I stopped drinking, but obviously now I’m ready to start again because it is my break.”</p><p>She went on to reveal that she had to cut out her favorite wine during her residency as it’s not great for her voice.</p><p>“I can’t drink red wine ever when I’m singing because I don’t know about you, but red wine f–ks me up. I cannot handle it,” Adele shared, adding that it gives her the “worst hangover” and “gets rid of [her] voice.” She now prefers to drink half sparkling water and half white wine with ice.</p><p>Adele added that she plans to “treat herself” when she feels better with an expensive bottle of Châteauneuf-du-Pape wine that she has stored away for a special occasion.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/adele-says-shes-ready-to-start-drinking-again-inline-01.jpg><p>It was at another one of her shows where the Grammy winner revealed that she is <a href=#>no longer drinking</a> after coming to the realization that she had an unhealthy relationship with alcohol in her 20s.</p><p>“I stopped drinking quite a long time ago … I stopped drinking, when did I stop drinking? It feels like forever,” Adele explained to the audience at one of her Las Vegas shows in October, per a&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>clip posted by a concertgoer via X</a>. “Maybe, like, three and a half months ago.”</p><p>Adele joked that “it’s boring” not drinking anymore, before adding: “I was literally borderline alcoholic for quite a lot of my twenties, but I miss it so much.”</p><p>The <a href=#>“Easy On Me”</a> songstress shared that she “cut out caffeine” as well.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/adele-says-shes-ready-to-start-drinking-again-inline-02.jpg><p>Adele previously noted that some of her struggles with substance abuse began when she lost her estranged father, <a href=#>Mark Evans</a>, in May 2021. Evans battled an alcohol addiction for the majority of his life and died from bowel cancer.</p><p>“I was always very fascinated by alcohol. It’s what kept dad from me,” she told<a href=# rel=noopener> Vogue</a> in October 2021. “So I always wanted to know what was so great about it.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>That same year, she noted that she turned to alcohol following <a href=#>her divorce</a> from <a href=#><strong>Simon Konecki</strong></a> in 2018. (The exes share son <a href=#>Angelo</a>, 11.)</p><p>“At first, I was probably keeping the alcohol industry alive,” she joked during her November 2021<a href=#> CBS Adele One Night Only</a> concert. “But you know, once I realized that I had a lot of work to do on myself, I stopped drinking and I started working out lots and stuff like that to keep me centered.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaanJWhsm6%2FwLKqZquYmsBuvsSam7JlpKR6tMDAq6tmnKKeu6y1zaBkmp%2BRnrtw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
