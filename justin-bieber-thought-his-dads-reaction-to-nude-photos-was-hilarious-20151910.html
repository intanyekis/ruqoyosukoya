A carefree <strong>Justin Bieber </strong>revealed in a new interview on Sunday, Oct. 18, that he thought his dad <strong>Jeremy Bieber</strong>'s reaction <a href=#>to his nude Bora Bora photos</a> — "#proud daddy" — was "hilarious."</p><p>Bieber, 21, spoke to the Zach Sang & The Gang radio show about the recent Internet-breaking, nude vacation photos, which featured the "What Do You Mean?" singer completely in the buff while vacationing with model Jayde Pierce. <a href=#>Alongside millions of other Beliebers</a>, the singer's dad took to his Twitter to chime in on the viral conversation.</p><p>"@justinbieber what do you feed that thing. #proud daddy," Jeremy first wrote in a now-deleted post. He followed up with a separate pic of a puppy and wrote, "He's a beaut."</p><p>"I thought it was hilarious. 'What do you feed that thing,'" Bieber quipped in his latest interview of his dad's brow-raising tweets. "It’s such a dad thing to say. When I found out people were hating on him for saying that, I was like, ‘Are you kidding me?’ What dad wouldn’t be proud of that? It’s not like he’s saying it to an 11-year-old. I’m 21 years old."</p><p>Bieber also joked that his many fans even bestowed a name upon his, um, junk. "They call it Jerry," he boasted on Sunday.</p><p>Kidding aside, Bieber felt that the nude shots — which were taken with a long lens camera from a distance — were <a href=#>an invasion of privacy</a>. "At the end of the day, the photos, they’re not terrible!" he said of the images, which featured him swimming, jumping around, and lounging nude on vacation. "I still felt like I wanted to keep that part for me, you know? …I felt like it was a little bit of an invasion of privacy. And when I first found out about it, I was like… my heart sank."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The nude pics weren't the only thing to recently affect the singer's privacy.
