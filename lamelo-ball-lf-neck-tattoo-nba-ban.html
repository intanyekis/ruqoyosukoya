The versatile guard is 12th in the league in scoring (25.9 points per game), and fifth in assists (8.6 per game), and is starting to look like the franchise player many touted him to be.</p><p>However, for the foreseeable future, Ball will be 'balling' with an unusual look.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>LaMelo Ball's 'LF' neck tattoo judged to violate NBA rules</h2><p>The <a href=#>NBA </a>has recently told the 22-year-old that he has to cover up a tattoo on his neck whenever he plays.</p><p>The tattoo in question is below Ball's left ear on the side of his neck. It is a red 'LF' which stands for LaFrance - Ball's middle name - and also the name of his apparel company which he started in 2020.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE NBA">READ MORE NBA</h2><p>The league has told LaMelo to cover up the neck tattoo because it allegedly violates the league's policies regarding the display of corporate logos and the promotion of commercial brands through tattoos.</p><p>In a statement to ESPN, NBA spokesman Tim Frank <a href=# aria-label="said (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>: "Per the [collective bargaining agreement], players are prohibited from displaying commercial logos or corporate insignia on their body or in their hair during games.</p><p>"We try to enforce the rule reasonably, in accordance with its purpose, and taking into account players' efforts to express themselves in a non-commercial manner. But LaMelo Ball's neck tattoo is in obvious violation of the rule and, accordingly, he's required to cover it."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/11/user-expressly-acknowledges-agrees-downloading-861766229.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talksport.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/11/user-expressly-acknowledges-agrees-downloading-861766203.jpg><p>Interestingly, the 2022 All-Star also has the same tattoo on his left hand, although that reportedly isn't in violation of the league rules because it isn't as easily seen during games.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Basketball</h2></p><p>Ball had used the LF initials long before it became a brand, and reportedly made the case that other NBA players have had what would be considered corporate logos on their bodies (e.g. Air Jordan, Carmelo Anthony's Warner Bros, tattoo).</p><p>However, the league argued those players do not have endorsement contracts with those companies while Ball obviously benefits from the sale of his clothing brandâ€™s merchandise.</p><p>As a result, Ball has been spotted wearing a blue bandage on his neck to cover up the ink.</p><p>Fortunately for him and the Hornets he's not let the issue affect his game. LaMelo recently became the second fastest (175 days) and third-youngest (22 years, 90 days) player in NBA history to reach 500 made threes in a career.</p><p>Duncan Robinson did the feat in 152 games while Luka Doncic and Anthony Edwards did it at a younger age.</p><p>After a slow start to the season, Ball is finally finding his groove. He led the Hornets with 36 points in their overtime win over the Boston Celtics this week and had 34 points, 13 assists and eight rebounds in a 117-114 win over the Washington Wizards.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaG4tLzOq6tnm5%2BifLS8zquraJqRqLimwMGao6VnYWuCdISSamalmZ2aubB5wZqjpWWcm3qvscKkZK2ZpKm8sHnNm5hmmpGjfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogL - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
